# Whisky Scraper 🥃🍾
This script scraps information of japanese whiskies from [Whisky exchange japanese](https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/c/35/japanese-whisky)

## Scraped Data
- text info is stored in whisky.csv file
- images are stored in images folder

I used concurrent.futures module to achieve concurrency that allowed me make asynchronous requests which in turn made my script run faster
