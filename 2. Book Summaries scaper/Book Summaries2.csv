Title,Short Summary,Full Summary
Confessions of an Economic Hitman by John Perkins,"The United States is engaging in a modern form of slavery by using the World Bank and other international organizations to offer huge loans to developing nations for construction projects and oil production. On the surface this appears to be generous, but the money is only awarded to a country if it agrees to hire US construction firms, which ensures a select few people get rich. Furthermore, the loans are intentionally too big for any developing nation to repay and this debt burden virtually guarantees the developing nation will support the political interests of the United States.","“Few swim in riches and the majority drown in poverty, pollution, and violence.” The top 1 percent of third world households account for 70 to 90 percent of all private financial wealth and real estate ownership in their country. There are (were?) a famous group of pirates in Indonesia known as the Bugi. They so terrorized early European sailors that the sailors came home and told their children, “Behave yourselves or the Bugimen will get you.” Crazy origin of the phrase. “The beacon shines on a destiny that is not always one we envision.” The imperialist and capitalist drive is so strong and so pervasive that it has become the primary cause of most wars, pollution, starvation, species extinctions, and genocides. Life is composed of a series of coincidences over which we have no control. Once we are presented with such coincidences, we gave choices. How we respond, the actions we take in the face of coincidences, makes all the difference. How many decisions (including ones of great historical significance that impact millions of people) are made by men and women who are driven by personal motives rather than by a desire to do the right thing? This book offers a startling reminder that debt is the new form of prison. Entire countries are handicapped by their debt to the United States and other major players. Lesson: avoid debt at all costs of you want to remain free. We decry slavery, but our global empire enslaves more people than the Romans and all other colonial powers before us."
Adapt by Tim Harford,"Seek out new ideas and try new things. When trying something new, do it on a scale where failure is survivable. Seek out feedback and learn from your mistakes as you go along.","The Toaster Project was when one man tried to build a toaster from scratch and realized the insane levels of complexity required. Our world is stunningly complex, but we are so engulfed in this complexity that we take it for granted. We are blind to it. We overestimate the impact any one person or leader can have because we fail to see how complex the problems are that current leaders face. The system we live in is far too complex for any one person to understand. Even developing expertise in a particular area isn't as useful as you would expect because of the interrelatedness of things with my areas you know nothing about. Failure is everywhere. Ten percent of American companies disappear every year. Perhaps the reason companies don't stay at the top is simply because the only way to go is down. It's really hard to stay at the top and perhaps being a Fortune 100 company relies on many factors outside your control and not simply running a good company. When those factors change, so does your incredible success. The market fumbles its way to success. The good ideas take off and less successful ones die out. It's like evolution for economics. Avoid survivorship bias. Don't just see success. See all the failures that led to the eventual success. The process of evolution strikes a balance between discovering the new and exploiting the familiar. The evolutionary mix of small steps and occasional wild gambles is the best possible way to search for solutions. Evolution produces ongoing “works for now” solutions and then builds upon those ideas. We are more blind than we think. Most real-world problems are more complex than we think. Seek out new ideas and try new things. When trying something new, do it on a scale where failure is survivable. Seek out feedback and learn from your mistakes as you go along. For some reason, we are obsessed with achieving uniformly high standards in industry even though it is precisely the opposite (variation and selection) that got us this far in the first place. In fact, if, for example, every hospital did things the same way, we would struggle to improve because nobody would test new ideas. There is a limit to how much honest feedback most leaders want to hear. Accepting trial and error means accepting error. And human brains don't seem to be very good at doing that. “A person who has not made peace with his losses is likely to accept gambles that would be unacceptable to him otherwise.”  -Kahneman and Tversky John Endler's guppy studies from the 1970s showcase how environment drives evolution. Make sure you know when you've failed. Measure your progress. Measurement can come in many forms. For example, Whole Foods requires new employees to do a four week trial period and they are only hired if they earn positive votes from 2/3 of their coworkers. This is a form of peer monitoring (or we could call it peer measurement). Google's 20 percent time is another example of peer monitoring because good side projects will gain the interest of peers. In a company where your peers decide who stays around, there is no room for people who don't pull their weight. 80 percent of Google's projects will fail, but that doesn't matter. People only remember the 20 percent that succeed. “Success is the number of experiments that can be crammed into 24 hours.” Formal theory won't get you nearly as far as an incredibly rapid systematic process of trial and error. Niche products grow and usurp incumbents precisely because they appeal only to a few users and seem inferior to incumbents. They get ignored long enough to grow into a serious threat. Fascinating reason new ideas get sabotaged within organizations: if new business models catch on they often require people with new skills and that means any big wig in the current business will lose status. So they consciously or unconsciously sabotage new ideas because they are inherently threatening to the career they have spent years building. Yet another reason you must be constantly willing to reinvent yourself. If you're going to fail in public, best to do it in front of a limited audience. You need a relatively safe space to fail. Hedonic editing is a way of avoiding thinking about losses and mistakes by convincing ourselves they aren't that bad. The three obstacles that prevent us from learning from our mistakes are 1) denial, 2) self-destructive behavior, 3) remembering past mistakes as triumphs. Our response to failure should be,  “I am not a failure, but I have made a mistake.”"
A Short Guide to a Happy Life by Anna Quindlen,"The only thing you have that nobody else has is control of your life. The hardest thing of all is to learn to love the journey, not the destination. Get a real life rather than frantically chasing the next level of success.","The only thing you have that nobody else has is control of your life. You job, your day, your heart, your spirit. You are the only one in control of that. “Show up. Listen. Try to laugh.” “You cannot be really good at your work if your work is all you are.” “Get a life, a real life. Not a manic pursuit of the next promotion.” “Turn off your cell phone. Keep still. Be present.” “Get a life in which you are generous.” “All of us want to do well, but if we do not do good too then doing well will never be enough.” “Knowledge of our own mortality is the greatest gift God gives us.”  It is so easy to exist rather than to live… Unless you know a clock is ticking. We live in more luxury today than ever before. The things we have today our ancestors thought existed for just the wealthy. And yet, somehow, we are rarely grateful for all this wealth. The hardest thing of all is to learn to love the journey, not the destination. “This is not a dress rehearsal. Today is the only guarantee you get.” “Think of life as a terminal illness.” “School never ends. The classroom is everywhere.”"
The 10X Rule by Grant Cardone,The 10X Rule says that 1) you should set targets for yourself that are 10X greater than what you believe you can achieve and 2) you should take actions that are 10X greater than what you believe are necessary to achieve your goals. The biggest mistake most people make in life is not setting goals high enough. Taking massive action is the only way to fulfill your true potential.,"The biggest mistake most people make in life is not setting goals high enough. The 10X Rule is based on understanding the level of effort and the level of thinking required to succeed. Operating at activity levels far beyond the normal is 10X action and execution. It will take you far. Set targets that are 10X the goals you would ever dream of. Your thoughts and actions are the reason you are where you are right now. In order to go farther than you ever thought possible you must both think and act at levels 10X beyond the norm. Why keep working once you have achieved a certain financial level of success? Because you can be happy while accomplishing things, not while resting and doing nothing. If you loved your wife and kids yesterday, should you just stop at that? Or should you build upon it? Same way with your work and legacy. Limiting the amount of success you desire is a violation of the 10X Rule. The 10X Rule: You must set targets for yourself that are 10X more than what you think you want and then take 10X the action you think is required to get there. Common mistake 1: setting your sights too low. Common mistake 2: underestimating how much action is required. Common mistake 3: spending too much time competing and not enough time dominating their sector. Common mistake 4: underestimating the amount of adversity they will have to overcome. Any goal you set is going to be difficult to achieve, so why not set them higher from the beginning? Most people feel like they are working – rather than chasing passion – because the payoff isn't large enough. You will either work to accomplish your goals and dreams or you'll be used to accomplish someone else's goals and dreams. Never reduce a target. Do not explain away failure. Always increase your actions. Nobody wins when you diminish the importance of success. People will say,  “success isn't everything.”  No shit. Of course success isn't everything. But it is important. And diminishing that importance with saying like “success isn't everything” gives you an excuse to limit your vision of success for yourself and the actions you take. It is your duty to be successful. Do not view success as an option. Being dependent on only one person or one solution for success is your fault. Winners bring in success from many different avenues. Politicians make all these promises, but your success (or your children's success) is not dependent on politics. Whether one person gets voted in or not does not determine if you will win. As long as the system provides the opportunity to succeed, no one individual, politics, or president will dictate your success – except you. Success by others is an indication that something is possible. It should inspire you. Those who use blame as a reason for not achieving success will never be successful. Victim thinking doesn't benefit you. If you're willing to take credit when you win then you have to be willing to take responsibility when you lose. Even when bad luck or random events strike there is always something you can do to be better prepared next time. If you were really legit, people would come to you.  Stop driving and flying to everyone. Step up your game. If people comment on your level of action, then you're doing something right. The biggest business problem is obscurity. Money and power follow attention. Rid yourself of average thinking and average action. Failing to think big in the beginning will lead to failing to act big. Set your goals 10X bigger than you think they should be. Top achievers don't copy or compete. They dominate. They set the pace. How can you get an unfair advantage? Never play by the agreed upon norms of your industry. Create new ways to dominate your sector. You don't have to be the first to do something, but you should be the best at it. Create “only” practices. What is something only you are doing? You have to be obsessed. Nobody has ever accomplished something incredible without obsession. The ability to be obsessed is not a disease. It is a gift. What goal would cause you to be obsessed? The saying “under commit and over deliver” is stupid. Instead, over commit and figure out how to show up at a higher level. Don't follow the pack. Lead the pack. Interesting trend: when people and businesses cut spending and focus on saving, they almost always save their energy, effort, and creativity as well. It is as if the mindset of dialing down spending naturally dials down activity in other areas. Success is like a garden. You must constantly tend to it and care for it. Most people never get close to being overexposed. Nearly everyone is hindered by obscurity. Last minute preparation is just a way to delay and be fearful. Focus on training better beforehand and when the resistance comes face it and take action. Fear is a signal to do what you fear right now. Do not feed fear by waiting and letting it build. Don't worry about time management or balance. Instead, focus on abundance. Don't think either/or. Instead, think all/everything. Time management is more about knowing your priorities clearly than finding balance. When the author had his first child, he and his wife created a time schedule for his daughter's sleep that allowed him to spend an hour with her each morning, maintain the same work calendar. The bonus was the daughter was asleep by 7pm, which meant uninterrupted spouse time. Nobody will save you or make you successful. Weak and overwhelmed individuals resort to criticism. Customer satisfaction is not nearly as big of a problem as “non-customer satisfaction.” People not knowing you exist and not buying your product is the real issue. Create an exit survey for non-buyers. (Anyone who leaves sales page?) Customer acquisition is the primary objective, not customer satisfaction. Customer complaints are not to be avoided. They are problems you can solve. Powerful companies and brands are omnipresent. You need to be everywhere. The best revenge against your critics is massive success. Duplicate the thoughts and actions of successful people and you too will become successful. Approach everything with the attitude that it can be done. Believe that you will figure it out. Losing money or a business never dominated your ability to take action. The author told his whole staff they needed to make 50 sales calls. Then he told them they needed to make the calls in 30 minutes. He went and made 28 calls in 22 minutes. The point is to stop analyzing and paralyzing yourself with overthinking. Just act. Challenge traditions and established ways of thinking. Don't worry about how much work it is. Think about how great the results will be. Commit first. Figure out the details later. Reach up in your relationships. Find people better than you. Taking massive actions is the only way to fulfill your true potential."
Are You Fully Charged? by Tom Rath,"There are three keys to being fully charged each day: doing work that provides meaning to your life, having positive social interactions with others, and taking care of yourself so you have the energy you need to do the first two things. Trying to maximize your own happiness can actually make you feel self-absorbed and lonely, but giving more can drive meaning and happiness in your life. People who spend money on experiences are happier than those who spend on material things.","Daily well being is what we should be targeting. The new research on daily experiences has changed the way we think about health, happiness, and well being. Scientists can now study the day to day experiences of individuals often in minimally invasive ways. (Fitbit, etc.) 3 keys to bring fully charged: meaning, positive interactions, and energy. “The odds of being completely engaged in your job increases by 250% it you work on meaningful projects each day.” The pursuit of meaning, not happiness is what makes life better. The more value you place on your own happiness, the more likely you are to feel lonely. If you spend your time seeking your own happiness then you end up feeling more shallow or self-absorbed. Meaning, however, makes you feel better by giving yourself to a cause bigger than yourself. Fredrickson's research found that 70% of people had higher happiness levels vs meaningfulness levels. These people displayed a similar genetic markers as those in stressful and adverse situations. Study of teenagers showed that those with a higher percentage of meaningful behaviors had lower levels of depression. 2014 study followed them for a full year and tested them in an fMRI scanner about hedonic acts vs meaningful acts. Spend time listing the positive impact your work does. Attach meaning to the small things you do and “connect the dots between your efforts and a larger purpose.” It's important to understand how you contribute value. The differences in how we view our work can just be a result of the stories we tell. You can tell a negative version of the story or you can tell a positive version. Which true version do you want to believe? Study of hospital workers by Raznoski found that people who made connections with patients and coworkers found more meaning in their work. Most people try to “squeeze meaning in around the edges” of their day rather than dedicating their work day to meaningful things. “Work for more than a living.” “Work is a purpose, not a place.” When figuring out what you should do each day begin by asking, “How can my time make a difference for others?” According to one research study, doubling your income only increases happiness by 9 percent. The game of upward comparison: “Satisfaction and income are almost entirely relative to ones comparison group.” Many successful people can live stressful and miserable lives if all they do is compare upwardly. Idea: compare downward to maintain perspective? Travel to poor areas? Etc. Most work days consist of small wins and tiny actions, not large external bonuses or rewards. You need meaning to drive you forward on most days. Spending more time working toward a shared mission will add meaning to your life. One of the downfalls of the “follow your passion” advice is that it assumes that putting your own passion and happiness at the center of your world is what leads to meaning, fulfillment and joy. That is often not the case. Focus on your strengths every day. People who do are 6x more likely to find meaning in their job. “Cast a shadow rather than living in one.” It's easy to fall into a default career path that is more about other people's expectations than your own interests. View work as the original social network. Just how negative and positive emotions can spread virally online, they can do the same in the office. For most of us, reactionary actions take up way more of our day than tasks we initiate. But most of the meaning we derive is from task we initiate, not reactions we fall into based on what others need. One study: people unlock their phones 110 times per day. “We lose 28% of our time each day.” Dan Gilbert study: participants reported a wandering mind 48% of the time and “a wandering mind is an unhappy mind.” (Think about how different a wandering mind is from a mind in flow. And we know that flow is one of the most happy and fulfilling experiences we can have.) Rest more: There is always the option to do nothing. Physical mail only shows up once per day and then we process it. But email is something we check all the time. (How can you blockemail and only answer once per day?) Finland's 45/15 break time … Covered by Tim Walker. “What the most productive people have in common is that they treat working time like a sprint (52 minutes on average) and then pairing it with a recharge session (17 minutes on average).” Idea: what if you treated work like practice? At practice each period is planned. Hell, each minute is planned. And then breaks are planned as well. “We need 3 to 5 interactions to make up for each negative one.” Being ignored is actually worse than hearing a negative comment. We often think that not telling someone bad news is preferable, but ignoring people is the worst possible option. We often assume the worst when we hear nothing — not to mention feeling lonely. The Contagion Effect in relationships explains why the people around us influence our own behaviors. (NEJM obesity study, smoking, etc.) People who spend money on experiences are happier than those who spend on material things. People who spend on other people end up happier AND it makes someone else happy too. Share the things you are planning with other people because anticipation increases well being. Give people the chance to anticipate great experiences. (Planning a vacation can often lead to more happiness than the vacation itself.) Energy is critical. Yes, doing things for others and living a life of meaning is important. But without energy you can't do your best work. “If you want to make a difference for years to come, you have to put your health and energy first.” Maintain a better balance of proteins to carbohydrates throughout the day. And reduce sugar. “People now spend more time sitting than sleeping, 9.3 hours per day.” “The average American spends over 15 hours per day sitting or sleeping.” “After sitting for two hours your good cholesterol drops by 20 percent.” 10,000 steps per day is a good baseline target of movement for most people. Exercise creates a twelve hour mood boost. This is a good reason to do something physical early in the morning. The 10,000 hours study by K. Anders Ericsson has a hidden finding most people ignore: the top performers slept over 8 hours on average. Rhinovirus and sleep study: those not getting efficient sleep were 5.5x more likely to get sick when exposed to the Rhinovirus. For better sleep avoid light, excessive heat, and noise. Chopsticks study: smiling, even when you don't feel like it, you experience less stress. Botox study: hindering the frowning muscles led to reduced rates of depression weeks later. “Giving improves well-being in many ways.”"
The Art of War by Sun Tzu,"Know when to fight and when not to fight: avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak. Know how to deceive the enemy: appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak. Know your strengths and weaknesses: if you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.","“According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one’s plans.” “All warfare is based on deception. Hence when able to attack we must seem unable. When using our forces we must seem inactive. When we are near we make the enemy believe we are far away. When far away we must make the enemy believe we are near.” “Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.” “If he is superior in strength, evade him.” “Attack him where he is unprepared. Appear where you are not expected.” “The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.” “There is no instance of a country having benefitted from prolonged warfare.” “A wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own.” “Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.” “The worst strategy of all is to besiege walled cities.” “There are five essentials for victory: He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win who’s army is animated by the same spirit throughout all it’s ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.” “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself, but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” “One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.” “In war, the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won.” “In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack: the direct and indirect.” “An army may march great distances without distress if it marches through country where the enemy is not.” “You can be sure in succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.” “Military tactics are like water. For water, in its natural course, runs away from high places and hastens downwards. So, in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak.” “Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move fall like a thunderbolt.” “Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.” “A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return.” “It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.” “The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy not coming, but on our readiness to receive him.” “Make your way by unexpected routes and attack unguarded spots.” “If they will face death, there is nothing they will not achieve.” “The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.” “If it is to your advantage, make a forward move. If not, stay where you are.”"
10% Happier by Dan Harris,"Practicing meditation and mindfulness will make you at least 10 percent happier. Being mindful doesn’t change the problems in your life, but mindfulness does help you respond to your problems rather than react to them. Mindfulness helps you realize that striving for success is fine as long as you accept that the outcome is outside your control.","“My preconceptions about meditation were misconceptions.” “In my experience, meditation makes you 10% happier.” Some of the traits we think are fixed like a quick temper or moody-ness or compassion are learned skills, not fixed characteristics. Many people assume they must be paranoid and worry if they want to stay at the top of their game. People care a lot about the bio on an author's page. “The best parts of Eckhart Tolle were a form of Buddhism.” Most improvements in life make very little difference and  that's fine . We spend so much time searching for transformational change in one easy step, but can we all just admit that were looking for the easy way out here? Just because you can't change everything at once doesn't mean you can't get better. In many cases, most cases in fact, you are only going to see a very small increase from each action. One workout builds a very small amount of muscle. That is what is to be expected. You're not doing it wrong if you get very tiny results. Most strategies deliver tiny results and require consistent over a long period of time. In the book, Harris makes a comment about therapy only working a little bit: “The limit isn't your therapist. The limit is therapy itself.” It makes a small difference, but it still makes a difference. The key is to embrace these daily marginal gains rather than dismissing them because they are small. Meditation is like doing focused reps for your mind. Focus on the breath, lose your focus, bring it back to the breath, repeat. This is the whole game. Keep bringing your mind back to the breath. How to meditate: sit somewhere comfortable, keep a straight spine, focus on a spot, and bring your focus back to your breath whenever you lose it. Meditation helps you shut down your monkey mind for a moment. We have 3 habitual responses to everything we experience: 1) We want it. 2) We reject it. 3) We zone out. Mindfulness is a fourth response. Viewing what happens in the world without an emotional response about it. “Mindfulness represents an alternative to living reactively.” Interesting self-sabotage insight: many people worry that if they meditate they will lose their edge and no longer be competitive or driven. “When you squelch something you give it power. Ignorance is not bliss.”  You should not run from your problems and pain. You should acknowledge them. The R.A.I.N. Technique for meditation: Recognize. Allow. Investigate. Non-identification. 1) Recognize: Acknowledge your feelings. 2) Allow: Where you lean into the pain. Let the pain be. 3) Investigate: Check out how the situation is impacting your body. Is my face hot? Is my back tight? Etc. 4) Non-identification: Realize that just because you feel pain or frustration or guilt or anger right now does not mean you are an angry or broken person. It is simply a phase happening at this moment, not your identity as a person. Mindfulness seems to be about awareness of the self. You recognize and acknowledge the things going on around you and the emotions you are feeling. Rather than let the emotion drive everything, you step outside of it and see it from afar. Being mindful doesn’t change the problems in your life. You still need to take action, but the key is that mindfulness allows you to respond rather than react to the problems in your life. Hedonic adaptation: the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes. A simple question to ask yourself when you’re worrying:  “Is this useful?” “I do meditation because it makes me 10 percent happier.” “Everything we experience in this world goes through one filter — our minds — and we spend very little time bothering to see how it works.” Meditation will make you more resilient, but it is not a “cure all” that fixes your problems or relieves all stress in your life. One Harvard study shows that gray matter grows in meditators. This is known as neuroplasticity. Scientists have developed a term for the consequence of all our multitasking: continuous partial attention. The Dalai Lama has a theory on selfishness: We should strive to be wise selfish rather than foolish selfish. Foolish selfish is when you focus on self-centered and shallow activities. Wise selfish is when you show compassion and help others because it benefits you and makes you feel good. Compassion is in our own self-interest. Make eye contact and smile at people. This simple habit that will make you feel more connected and much better each day. When police officers or first responders are interviewed about how and why they acted in a particular way during an emergency they often say,  “My training kicked in.”  I like this idea of training yourself to be mindful, aware, compassionate, and so on. These are traits that can be trained and then will automatically reveal themselves when needed (assuming you’ve practiced enough). Don’t confuse letting go with going soft. Just because you’re aware of what is going on and being mindful about it does not mean you just let things go when you have the ability to take action on them and improve. The way to respond to adversity is often to work through it, not to avoid it altogether in the name of acting Zen. Striving for success is fine as long as you realize that the outcome is not under your control. Be as ambitious as possible, but let go of the result. This makes it easier for you to be resilient and bounce back if the result is poor. Buddhism is  “advanced common sense.”  It requires you to analyze simple fundamentals until a deeper understanding is achieved. 10 Buddhist Principles for the Modern Worker: 1) Don’t be a jerk. 2) When necessary, hide the Zen. 3) Meditate. 4) The price of security is insecurity, until it’s not useful. 5) Equanimity is not the enemy of creativity. 6) Don’t force it. 7) Humility prevents humiliation. 8) Go easy with the internal cattle prod. 9) Non-attachment to results. 10) Ask,  “What matters most?” “Meditation is the super power that makes all the other precepts possible.”"
The Art of Possibility by Rosamund Zander and Benjamin Zander,"Everything in life is an invention. If you choose to look at your life in a new way, then suddenly your problems fade away. One of the best ways to do this is to focus on the possibilities surrounding you in any situation rather than slipping into the default mode of measuring and comparing your life to others.","Everything in life is based on your reference frame. Look at things in a new way and suddenly your problems fade away. It’s all invented. Everything in life is an invention. The way we see things. The way we measure things. The way we compete. The way we judge ourselves. If it’s all invented, then you might as well invent a way of viewing life that benefits you. You might as well invent a frame of possibility. Give an A. If you automatically assume the best and give everyone an A in life, then you let the best come out in them and you remove a lot of the barriers that have been the relationship back. Nearly everyone lives in The Measurement World without realizing it. Everything we do is based on measurement in our lives. How much money we make. Whether our team wins. How beautiful our spouse is. Everything is based around some form of measurement. You don’t need to play the measurement game. You can play the possibility game. You can live in The Possibility World. Instead of focusing on how you measure up, focus on how you contribute to the world around you. Contribution is not measured based on other people. It’s only measured based on what you put into the world around you. That’s it. If you add something, you contributed. Assignment for yourself: write down all the ways in which you have been a contribution to the world around you in the last week. There is no space for your failures or missteps. You only get to list how you contributed in a positive way. A leader who feels he is superior is likely to suppress the visions of the very people he needs to rely on to succeed. The conductor can lead the most powerful orchestra in the world, but does not make a sound. His or her only power is in getting the players to produce the beautiful sound they are capable of. What would I say if I was suddenly called upon to lead? How much greatness do we expect of those around us? It matters. Rule #6: Don’t take yourself so damn seriously. If you are worried about making a mistake, imagine that a 500-pound cow will fall on your head. The Calculating Self is who runs our lives in The Measurement World. The Central Self is who runs our lives in The Possibility World. What would have to change to make this possible? Redraw the box in your mind to create a reference frame that embraces the way things actually are and allows you to see them in a new way. Zander’s music professor to him when he struggled to learn a new piece quickly: “You mean, you’ve been playing for THREE MINUTES and you STILL haven’t mastered it?” Be with the way things are. We have to distinguish our thoughts and feelings about the events from how the events actually are. We often let our feelings about how things should be prevent us from being with the moment and taking appropriate action. We get so wrapped up in things not being as we wish they would that we prevent ourselves from moving forward. Separate our conclusions about events from our descriptions of the events themselves. The more attention you shine on a subject, the more evidence of it you find. This is how downward spiral talk escalates into a reality. People who describe the glass as half full are not delusional optimists. In fact, they are more based in reality because they are describing a substance that is actually in the glass. They are describing reality as it is. The cynic who describes the glass as half empty is focusing their energy on something that is not actually there. It is the framework of scarcity — the belief that it exists — that causes divisions between people, not actual scarcity. Don't focus on being the best in the world. Focus on being the best FOR the world. When you break a bone, you don't blame it on the leg or the arm. It is a problem of the entire body. What if we acted that way in society? Instead of blaming groups for violence or terrorism, we see it as a problem for all of society, something we all have a responsibility to solve. The Truth and Reconciliation Project in South Africa united people who had been on opposing sides during Apartheid. It was through connection of enemies, not revenge, that the country found healing."
Free Will by Sam Harris,"We do not have the freedom and free will that we think we do. Yes, you can make conscious choices, but everything that makes up those conscious choices (your thoughts, your wants, your desires) is determined by prior causes outside your control. Just because you can do what you want does not mean you have free will because you are not choosing what you want in the first place.","The concept of free will is pervasive in our world. “How can we make sense of our lives and hold people accountable for their choices given the unconscious origins of our conscious minds?” “We do not have the freedom we think we have… Either our wills are determined by prior causes and we are not responsible for them. Or they are the product of chance and we are not responsible for them.” “The intention to do one thing and not another does not originate in consciousness. Rather it appears in consciousness. As does any thought or impulse that might impose it.” There are famous studies done with fMRI techniques which show that our brains will indicate the choice we are going to make 700 milliseconds before we are aware that we are going to make the choice. Other studies have found even larger discrepancies of 7-10 seconds. You cannot decide your next mental state, thought, or action until it arises. Where is the freedom in that process? “There is no question that most, if not all, mental events are the product of physical events. The brain is a physical system entirely beholden to the laws of nature. And there is every reason to believe that changes in its functional state and material structure entirely dictate our thoughts and actions.” “Consider what it would actually take to have free will. You would need to be aware of all the factors that determine your thoughts and actions, and you would need to be in complete control of these factors.” “We know that determinism in every sense relevant to human behavior is true. Unconscious neural events determine our thoughts and actions, and are themselves determined by prior causes of which we are subjectively unaware.” Just because you can do what you want does not mean you have free will. Why? Because you are not consciously choosing what you want. You simply want it. You can’t explain why you want it, but you do. And so choosing to do what you want (or choosing one want over another) does not mean you have free will because your wants have been given to you not determined by you. We make a mistake by separating our “free will” from our neural processes. The neural processes that support consciousness and nudge our actions are just as much a part of us as our conscious actions. The machinery that drives our actions is just as real as the actions themselves. All sorts of studies in behavior have proven that we often attribute the actions we take to incorrect causes. We reason backwardly and create all sorts of causes for our actions. In this case, Harris is arguing that we don’t merely do this sometimes, but all the time. He says that free will is an illusion and we do not fully understand what really drives our actions. This is a discussion of the underlying causes of human behavior. In many cases, these causes are hidden to us. Harris acknowledges that, although free will does not exist, we can create a framework for our choices which makes certain outcomes more likely than others. For example, you can remove all candy from your house to reduce the odds of eating sweets. Whether you feel the urge to eat sweets, however, is not something you have control over. Your “wants” simply are. They are not things you control. “You can change your life and yourself through effort and discipline. But you have whatever capacity you have for effort and discipline is what you have at this moment. And not a scintilla more. Or less.” “You wanted to lose weight for years. Then you REALLY wanted to. What's the difference? Whatever it is, it's not a difference you brought into being.” This has implications for how we judge criminals and interpret actions. If we understand that it is very possible to be dealt a bad hand in life — bad genetics, bad parents, bad experiences — then we begin to realize that even criminals have a deeper story that influences their actions. In a world like this, crimes, even heinous ones, are not easily attributed to free will and bad ideas. It’s a more compassionate view of our fellow humans. “The urge for retribution depends on our not seeing the underlying causes of human behavior.” This doesn’t mean we don’t need a criminal justice system nor do we need to separate dangerous people from society. “Not only are we not as free as we think we are, we do not feel as free as we think we do… Thoughts and intentions simply arise in our mind. What else could they do?” It is impossible for us to know the causes of our choices and wants."
The Art of Profitability by Adrian Slywotzky,There are many ways to make profit and it is unlikely that your business does all of them. People will pay different prices for the same thing in different situations (think: Coke in the grocery store vs. Coke in a nice restaurant). Good profit models are easy to brainstorm and hard to execute.,"There are many ways to make profit and it is unlikely that your business all of them. Most people don't care enough about profitability. Always do the math yourself. Too many people take numbers from unreliable sources. There are 4 levels of learning: Awareness, Awkwardness, Application, Assimilation Customer-Solution Profit: Know your customers incredibly well and create a solution specifically for them. Pyramid Profit: Different customers have different price sensitivities. This profit model works with that. Multiple tiers: Firewall (low-priced tier at bottom that can't reasonably be underpriced by a competitor), Next tier (mid-range products that you upsell and cross-sell to from the low-priced tier), Premium tiers (higher-priced products that loyal customers buy) Multi-Component Profit: Same product, several businesses. People will pay different prices for the same thing in different situations (think: Coke in the grocery store vs. Coke in a nice restaurant). Switchboard Profit: Act as a power broker between buyers and sellers. Only works well if you can get 15 percent of the market or more because deals flow in your direction given your network on both sides of the deal. Time Profit: Be faster, be newer, be innovative. Be there before everyone else and exploit the advantage for as long as you can. Blockbuster Profit: Have a huge product launch. Think movies, books, and pharmaceutical product launches. Profit-Multiplier Model: Take one skill and make money from it in many ways. (e.g. Disney turns movies into tee shirts, amusements parks, toys and more.) Entrepreneurial Profit: Operate lean and avoid all the wasted resources that major corporations can afford to have. We can't afford to “subside non-entrepreneurial behavior.” Specialist Profit: Lower costs because of better knowledge. Higher price because of better knowledge and stronger reputation. Installed Base Profit: Initial sales margins are slim, but money is made on the follow up sales. (Think: revenue from cars vs. revenue from car repairs.) De Facto Standard Profit: The more people who buy, the more valuable your become. Network effects drive your profit up. Brand Profit: Pay enough for your brand and you win because people know you. (Personal note: I hate this one.) Specialty Product Profit: Develop new niche products and create them with above average materials, then charge a premium price. Local Leadership Profit: Be everywhere and then every store is like a billboard (Starbucks, Walmart, etc.) Transaction Scale Profit: Specialize in high paying, highly profitable markets. (Think: a real estate agent who only sells $1M+ homes.) Value Chain Position Profit: Certain places in the value chain are incredibly profitable while others are not. Look for these key control points. Cycle Profit: Adjust rates based on the cycle. (Think: Travel industry rates for low, mid, and high season.) After-Sale Profit: Drive profit with upsells, cross-sells, and supplemental products. Accessories, replacement parts, etc. New Product Profit: There is a profit explosion at the beginning of a product's life. The Profit Parabola: “The total profit earned by all players in a market goes up, peaks, and comes back down to zero.” (i.e. Get in on the first half when profit is rising, not the last half.) Relative Market Share Profit: Companies with higher market share tend to be more profitable. Experience Curve Profit: Experience in serving the market results in lower transaction costs and, eventually, higher profit. Low-Cost Business Design Profit: The lower the costs of running your business, the higher your profit will be. You don't need high revenues to make high profit with a low-cost business. This is one of the reasons why digital businesses are so attractive. Big transactions are a function of relationships. Good profit models are easy to brainstorm and hard to execute."
A Technique for Producing Ideas by James Webb Young,"An idea occurs when you develop a new combination of old elements. The capacity to bring old elements into new combinations depends largely on your ability to see relationships. All ideas follow a five-step process of 1) gathering material, 2) intensely working over the material in your mind, 3) stepping away from the problem, 4) allowing the idea to come back to you naturally, and 5) testing your idea in the real world and adjusting it based on feedback.","The quality of your work (and life) is a result of all the forces that have played upon you throughout life. The goal is to make the most of those forces. In learning anything, first you should learn the principles, then you should learn the method. Particular bits of knowledge are just  “rapidly aging facts.”  What matters are the underlying principles and methods. You can know every fact about an industry and still not be a real expert because you don’t understand the underlying principles and methods. What is most valuable to know is not where to look for a particular idea, but how to train the mind in the method by which all ideas are produced; and how to grasp the principles which are at the source of all ideas. An idea is nothing more or less than a new combination of old elements. The capacity to bring old elements into new combinations depends largely on the ability to see relationships. What is the one word which will best arouse the emotion with which I wish this particular advertisement to be charged? The habit of searching for relationships between facts becomes of the highest importance in the production of ideas. Books on social psychology are often better books about advertising than actual books on advertising. There are five critical steps that everyone follows whenever they produce a new idea. Step 1: gather new material. This includes specific material (related to the product or task) and general material (fascination with a wide range of concepts). Step 2: work over the materials in your mind. Mentally “chew” your new material by looking at the facts from different angles and experimenting with fitting ideas together. Step 3: put the problem completely out of your mind and go do something else that excites you and energizes you. Step 4: your idea will come back to you with a flash of insight, only after you have stopped straining. Step 5: shape and develop your idea into practical usefulness. Put your idea out into the world, submit it to criticism, and adapt it as needed. On getting intimate knowledge of a product: most people stop too soon. If the surface differences are not striking, we assume that there are no differences. But if we go deeply enough, or far enough, we nearly always find that between every product and some consumers there is an individuality of relationship which may lead to an idea. The greatest way to develop general knowledge on a subject is to get genuinely interested in something. Living in a curious way and becoming fascinated with things is a fantastic way to live and it will ensure you never run out of ideas. The more general knowledge you have, the more opportunity you have for creating new relationships and connections between ideas. In advertising, an idea results from a new combination of specific knowledge about products and people with general knowledge about life and events. A great many ideas are lost in the final stage. The idea man, like the inventor, is often not patient enough or practical enough to go through with adapting his ideas to fit the actual conditions of the world. Good ideas have self-expanding qualities. When someone sees it, they naturally tell you what should be added and how to make it better. If your idea is good, people will tell you how to improve it. Listen to them. Don’t hold the initial version too close to your chest. There are some advertisements you just cannot write until you have lived long enough. The cycle of years does something to fill your reservoir, unless you refuse to live spatially and emotionally. The central idea of the book reminds me of the Robert Frost quote,  “An idea is a feat of association, and the height of it is a good metaphor.”"
Intimations of Paradise by Christopher Burkett,A book of 73 photos by master landscape photographer Christopher Burkett.,"Burkett spends two months shooting and ten months processing his images. Interesting and it says a lot about what it takes to create great work. Burkett has this composition of trees he repeats over and over where he will fill the frame with color by cropping out the edges of these branches. I really like it after seeing him do it so well. Plate 3 and Plate 10 are great examples. He does a great job of backlighting trees in autumn with dark backgrounds. Really makes the image pop. Plate 5, Plate 8, and Plate 40 are great examples. The vertical lines in his images are fantastic. Plate 20, for example. Plate 33 and Plate are fascinating. It is so hard to take a macro of tree trunks and rock walls, but these are really good. He does a remarkable job of using the surrounding landscape features to frame the focal point of the image. Plate 59 and Plate 68 are masterful. I love how he produces incredible images while still maintaining the imperfections of nature. The leaves have holes. The branches are broken. And yet, the images are breathtaking. They feel so real."
The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy,"The compound effect is the strategy of reaping huge rewards from small, seemingly insignificant actions. You cannot improve something until you measure it. Always take 100 percent responsibility for everything that happens to you.","“Talk about things that matter with people who care.” -Jim Rohn The compound effect is the operating system that has been running your life whether you know it or not. “There are no new fundamentals.” -Jim Rohn Success is doing a half dozen things really well, repeated five thousand times. You don't need more knowledge. You need a new plan of action. Consistency is the ultimate key to success. If you aren't better, work harder. The compound effect is the strategy of reaping huge rewards from small, seemingly insignificant actions. Small choices + consistency + time = significant results. Tony Robbins' no man's land concept is when you're not really happy about your life, but you're not unhappy enough to do anything about it. You want to avoid this complacency. Knowledge uninvested is wasted. Choice is at the center of all success and failure. It is what we choose that makes the biggest difference. Too often we sleepwalk through our choices. We default to choices that our society and culture tells us we should do. It's not big choices, but ones that you think don't matter or count for much that derail us. You don't consciously think about it, but these small decisions can really change things. Keep a daily gratitude journal about your spouse. Write down one thing you are thankful for each day about your spouse then give them the book as a gift one year later. Gratitude is acknowledging there are people in your life who have done things for you that you couldn't do for yourself. What you appreciate, appreciates. You have to be willing to give 100 percent in your relationships. Always take 100 percent responsibility for everything that happens to you. You alone are responsible for your situation. Everyone has the opportunity to be lucky. If you live in a free society, you are lucky. The first step toward change is awareness. The best way to become aware is to measure. Writing it all down is key. Tracking your progress and missteps is key for long-term success. Track your behavior for at least one week. All winners are trackers. You cannot improve something until you measure it. Professional athletes are particularly big trackers. Tracking will revolutionize your life. The author started by tracking every financial decision in a notebook. Merely becoming conscious of your actions begins to change them. Every dollar you spend today is costing you $5 in twenty years. (Because of opportunity cost from investing.) Making small course corrections will result in exactly zero applause. The difference between the number one golfer and number ten golfer is just 1.9 strokes. The difference prize money is huge. Start by saving 1 percent of your money each month. Then save 2 percent the next month. Continue until you are saving 10 percent of what you earn. Dave Ramsey: personal finance is 80 percent behavior. The earlier you start making changes the more the compound effect works in your favor. The key to success is this: are you learning each day? No business is going to keep someone around just for showing up. You have to continually get ready. Your life is a result of your moment to moment choices. The older your habits are and the deeper their roots, the harder they are to change. It stands to reason that since you learned every habit you have, you can also learn new ones. If the nose of a plane is pointed just one percent off course when it leaves LA for New York, it will end up in Delaware once it gets to the east coast. The most motivating choices are ones that align with your “why” and your purpose. You need a deep why for doing stuff. With a why that is meaningful enough, you will do almost anything. (Think of Kristy exercising for the wedding.) Too many people focus on achievement without fulfillment. If you create goals for yourself that have friction with your values, you're going to self-sabotage or feel guilty about your progress. For example, if your family is a high priority, but you set high financial goals for yourself then there is friction between those two goals. (Note: this is basically identity-based habits. You can't have friction between your identity and your goals.) Design the life you want first and the business you want second. Most people choose a career before thinking about what kind of life they want to build. (Note: great idea. Even better idea might be to test lifestyles. Try one project in various “lives” and see which you enjoy most. Write a book (author), show a photo project in a gallery (photographer), etc.) The Law of Attraction is simply directing your attention toward something that was already there. Write down your most important goals. When you set a goal, most people ask, “What do I need to do to achieve your goal?” Instead, you should ask “Who do I need to become?” What is your entertainment vs. education ratio? The top 20% of people spend their time focused on education. Stop watching the news. The news just aggregates the worst, saddest, and most stressful stories every day. If there is a difference between what you say and what you do, then your behavior is the winner. Identify your triggers for your bad habits: the who, what, where, and when that prompts you to start your bad habits. Start by eliminating your triggers. Throw out junk food, etc. Stop lying and justifying hard choices by saying things like, “It's not fair for everyone to avoid sweets just because I don't want to eat sweets.” Dean Ornish study found it was easier for people to ditch lots of bad habits at the same time. Any new habit has to work inside your current life and lifestyle. The gym can't be out of the way. It has to be on the way. Montell Williams has an add-in principle where he focuses on adding something in to his life rather than what he is cutting out or sacrificing. Hardy recommends using a Seinfeld calendar for public accountability too. Hangout in the office, etc. so other people can see it. Be patient. You've spent years repeating bad behaviors. It's going to take years to build good ones. Momentum is huge. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. The hardest part of momentum is the beginning. But like pushing the merry-go-round on the playground… Once you get moving you can keep going very easily. With momentum, you can continue succeeding with less work. It's easy to keep things running once you have momentum. Jack Nicklaus had a repeated pre-shot routine that he did the same way over and over again. A psychologist tracked his pre-shot time for every shot at a tournament and it never wavered by more than one second. Set yourself up for success. Book end your days. You can always ensure how your day starts and ends. Finish your most important tasks first. Review your day each evening. Commit to doing a relationship review each weekend. Cover what went well in your marriage that week. Rank your relationship on a scale of 1-10 over the last week and then ask what could get it to a 10. “Anyone can fall in love. Falling in love is easy. Staying in love takes real work.” When you lose two weeks of work, you don't just lose the work you would have done. You also lose momentum and that is the bigger problem. Garbage in, garbage out. Don't waste your time watching TV, eating junk, reading useless stuff, consuming negative stories, and more. Who is on your personal board of advisors? Who are the 10-12 experts you get advice from? The best people hire the best coaches. Harvey McKay had 20 coaches. A speech coach, writing coach, humor coach, etc. What are you willing to tolerate? If you tolerate people being late that is what you'll get. If you tolerate earning less than what you're worth, that's what you'll earn. (This is similar to Mark Manson's idea of “what kind of pain do you want?” Except here it is applied to the negative forces in our life whereas he applies it to our goals and ambitions.) Oprah's 2004 season opener is one of the greatest product launches and examples of going above and beyond expectations. Always go a little bit beyond what people expect. Dress a little nicer. Try a little harder. There is a difference between learning and studying. Learning leads to knowledge. Studying a topic means you are invested in it and try it out. The world already has tons of knowledge. You don't need to learn more. What you need is to study, to practice, and to take action on the knowledge you have."
Confessions of the Pricing Man by Hermann Simon,"Ultimately, profit is the only valid metric for guiding a company and there are only three ways to influence profit: price, volume, and cost. Of these three factors, prices get the least attention, but have the greatest impact. The price a customer is willing to pay, and therefore the price a company can achieve, is always a reflection of the perceived value of the product or service in the customer’s eyes.","Never run a business in which you have no influence on the prices you charge. I don’t think much of a business that doesn’t make money. Prices determine how much money you make. Pricing is about how people divide up value. The value we perceive changes as the product ages. A business team may have many viable options, but can choose only one. These decisions involve so many factors and face so many market dynamics that black-and-white certainty is rare. Prices are the central hinges of a market economy. Think about it: every dollar of revenue and profit that a company generates is the direct or indirect result of a price decision. How much does one minute cost on your mobile phone plan? How much do you pay for 1 kWh of electricity? How much does your daily commute cost you? It is hard to answer these questions spontaneously, because for many goods and services, prices have many dimensions. There is always one “right” price or price structure and a multitude of “wrong” ones. The Russians have a saying which sums this up: “In every market there are two kinds of fools. One charges too much, the other charges too little.” People have asked me thousands of times to name the most important aspect of pricing. I answer with one word: “value.” The price a customer is willing to pay, and therefore the price a company can achieve, is always a reflection of the perceived value of the product or service in the customer’s eyes. When a company tries to figure out the price it can achieve, only the subjective (perceived) value of the customer matters. The objective value of the product or other measures of value, such as the Marxian theory that value is defined by the human labor time invested, do not matter intrinsically. They matter only to the degree that the customer thinks they matter and is willing to a pay a price in return. Expectations about how the value lasts will have a decisive influence on a customer’s willingness to pay for luxury goods, consumer durables, and cars. The process of price setting begins at the conception of the product idea. A company must think about prices as early and often as possible in the development process, not just after a product is ready to launch. As the French say, “ le prix s’oublie, la qualité reste.” Loosely translated, that means that the quality you bought endures long after you have forgotten the price. Better be cheated in the price than in the quality of goods. I learned that good advice is not expensive. It is quite affordable, if you can recognize its value. Offering true value is a necessary but by no means sufficient condition for success. Far too often I have heard managers claim that if you make a good product, it will sell itself. The only fundamental driver of willingness to pay is the perceived value in the eyes of the customer. Two of the most powerful intangible benefits we willingly pay for every day are convenience and peace of mind. Whenever possible, you should try to communicate value using hard data, especially in a business-to-business situation. In economic terms, the most important role price plays is in creating a balance between supply and demand. These assumptions about rationality and information first came into doubt through the work of Herbert A. Simon1 (Nobel Prize, 1978). In his view, people have only limited capacity to absorb and process information. For that reason, they do not strive to maximize their profit and their utility. Instead, they content themselves with a “satisfactory” outcome. He coined the term “satisficing” to describe this behavior. This reinforces a key lesson in this book: you need to know what your demand curve looks like, the more precisely, the better. Price is likely to serve as an indicator of quality when buyers are uncertain about a product’s underlying quality. This happens when they are confronted with a product that is entirely new to them or one which they rarely buy. In one test, study participants received a pain reliever at different prices. One group saw a tag with a high price, and the other group saw a low price. Without exception, the participants in the high-price group claimed that the pain reliever was very effective. In the low-price group, only half of the participants made that claim. In both cases, however, the pain reliever was actually a vitamin C placebo, which has no objective ability to relieve pain. When buyers know neither the price range of a product category nor have any special requirements (e.g., high quality, low price), they gravitate toward a price in the middle of the range. The less a buyer knows objectively about the quality of the products and prices in an assortment, the stronger the pull of the “magic of the middle” will be. One of the cleverest tricks to boost sales is to create the perception of scarcity. We have observed time and again that the introduction of additional alternatives can significantly increase sales and shift demand toward higher priced products. A price threshold is a price point which triggers a pronounced change in sales whenever it is crossed. The most important argument for the existence of odd prices is that customers perceive the digits in a price with decreasing intensity as they read from left to right. The first digit in a price has the strongest influence on perception; that is, a price of $9.99 comes across as $9 plus something rather than $10. My own findings show that it makes no sense to set prices at $9.90 or $9.95. If you want to remain below a price threshold, then you should set your price as close to the threshold as possible, which means $9.99 in this case. The pain we feel from a loss is greater than the happiness we feel from a gain, even if the magnitude of the loss and gain themselves is equal. It is particularly advisable for people with limited financial means to use cash payments as a control mechanism. When we receive our monthly statement and see that long list of transactions, the effect of any individual transaction gets watered down. This also hurts less. The standard way of expressing a price—for example $16.70—causes a pronounced response in the brain’s pain center. The response is weaker, however, when the respondent only sees 16.70 and the dollar sign is omitted. Apparently the brain does not immediately perceive that number to be a price. The activation of the pain center is even weaker for a round number, such as 17. A high margin results only in high profit if you achieve a sufficient gap between price and costs. That is not a trivial observation. Even when a company does achieve high margins, it still needs to sell enough units to make a high profit. Premium pricing means offering higher value and demanding a premium price in return. Gillette practices premium pricing of the best kind: creating value through innovation, communicating that value, and then extracting it with premium price Superior value is a must: Premium pricing will work over time only if a company offers superior value to customer. Innovation is the foundation: In general, innovation provides the foundation for a successful, sustainable premium price position. This applies to groundbreaking innovations as well as continual improvements, such as Miele ’s under the motto “Forever Better.” Consistent, high quality is a must: This prerequisite comes up time and again. Successful premium suppliers maintain high and very consistent quality levels. Their service must also meet the same requirements. Premium pricers have strong brands: One function of these strong brands is to transform a technological advantage—which is often temporary—into a long-lasting image advantage. Premium pricers invest heavily in communication: They know that they have to make the value and advantages of their products perceptible and understandable to consumers. Remember: only perceived value counts. Premium pricers shy away from special offers: They are hesitant to offer promotions and special offers. If the promotions they offer are too frequent or too steep, these instruments can endanger the premium price position. The key secret to the art of pricing luxury goods is mastering “limited editions.” The supplier must strictly abide by its own limit; otherwise it risks losing its credibility and reputation. The limited number of units determines the scarcity and thus the value of the luxury good. Watches manufactured in Switzerland represent just 2 % of the world’s annual watch production. Yet on the back of this tiny volume, the Swiss watches altogether account for an incredible 53 % of the global watch market on a value basis.36 The difference between their volume-based market share (2 %) and their value-based market share (53 %) is dramatic. When a customer pays a very high price for a product, he or she expects that the product will hold its value. Their research revealed two success guidelines, which they referred to as “better before cheaper” and “revenue before cost.” These interesting findings imply that the share of companies which are successful with a premium price strategy is greater than the share of companies which have achieved sustained success with low-price strategies. “Very rarely is cost leadership a driver of superior profitability .” After 40 years in the pricing game I am convinced that only very few companies will achieve long-term success with a low-price strategy. Profit is ultimately the only valid metric for guiding your company. The rationale is simple: profit is the only metric which takes both the revenue side and the cost side of a business into account. “Profit is a condition of survival. It is the cost of the future, the cost of staying in business.” Price setting requires a thorough understanding of two things: how your customers perceive your value and the profit level you need to sustain or improve that value. The reality in almost all companies is that goal setting is not an “either-or” exercise. Balance is paramount. The central problem is that most companies are not balanced. This means that every business has only three profit drivers: price, volume, and cost. Prices get the least attention, but have the greatest impact. The obsessive pursuit of the wrong goals—customer counts, revenue, and market share —leads even the sharpest managers to neglect the effects that discounts and promotions have on profits. Price is the only marketing instrument you can employ with no upfront investment. This makes it an especially powerful marketing tool for small business or start-ups with tight financial resources. Sellers have some leeway in setting prices. This leeway can be substantial if the product is innovative or even unique. “Pricing is guesswork. It is usually assumed that marketers use scientific methods to determine the price of their products. Nothing could be further from the truth. In almost every case, the process of decision is one of guesswork.” All paths to profit begin with price. This is an important insight. It means that it is not the end of the world if you don’t have the optimal price figured out down to the last decimal place. It is more important to be in the right vicinity. If your product delivers 20 % more value than the competitors’ products, you should collect 10 % of that difference in price. If you demand more—or demand it all—the customer actually never gets to enjoy the difference in value. If your value difference is 20 % and your price difference is 20 %, the customer comes out of the deal empty-handed despite the greater value you provide. You offset the entire advantage for the customer by setting the product’s price too high Past market data has very limited relevance for predicting future behavior George Stigler, who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1982, claims that price leadership is the best solution for companies in a highly competitive oligopoly We can see from these comparative graphs that one uniform price —even when set optimally—exhausts only part of the available profit potential in the market. A prerequisite for optimal price differentiation is detailed knowledge about the buyers’ willingness to pay When a seller packages several products together and charges a total price less than the sum of the individual product prices, it is called price bundling. Bundling is a very effective way to differentiate prices. Sellers should choose incremental discounts whenever possible. For buyers the opposite advice applies. They should ask for full-volume discounts. In other words both buyers and sellers should focus not only on the percentage of discount they receive, but also the structure of the discount. “Big Data,” the analysis of large amounts of data about transactions on an individual basis, opens up fantastic new opportunities for person-specific price differentiation. Interesting here is the question of whether consumers should occasionally order a very inexpensive product, in order to convey a high level of price sensitivity to the seller. This could trigger advertisements for special offers and attractive prices—a new kind of cat-and-mouse game. Individuals at different times have different levels of willingness to pay Using a penetration strategy is recommended for experience goods. These are products which require a consumer to gain some experience with them in order to understand their true value. A low price at launch motivates more customers to give the product a try, and can create a multiplier effect if customers have a positive experience and start to comment on or even evangelize about the product. Apple supplemented its skimming strategy with continuous innovation and an expansion of its product line. This process is sometimes called “versioning,” the ongoing introduction of new versions. Each new version offers superior performance compared to the previous generation, which allows Apple to keep the prices for its devices relatively constant. The high art of pricing lies in intelligent price differentiation In the case of nonlinear pricing, one must know the marginal utilities for each additional unit. Without knowledge of willingness to pay as a function of time, location, or other criteria which will serve as the basis for differentiation, managers are stumbling around in the dark. Reaping the rewards of price differentiation is a “micro” task and not a “macro” one. It requires a microscopic perspective, not a rough or back-of-the-envelope calculation. Gut feeling, no matter how much experience may back it up, hits its limits on questions of price differentiation. One must understand willingness to pay at the individual level as narrowly as possible, in order to take advantage of it through a differentiated price structure Successful price differentiation requires the ability to separate customers effectively according to their willingness to pay Fencing is effective when the value difference between the two price categories is sufficiently large and the seller can control access. That means that the highest price category needs to offer correspondingly high value, and the value in the lowest price category is kept intentionally low. The French engineer Jules Dupuit noted this necessity way back in 1849. At that time, the lowest class passenger rail cars did not have a roof. “It is not because of the few thousand Francs which would have to be spent to put a roof over the third class seats,” Dupuit explained. “What the company is trying to do is to prevent the passenger who can pay the second class fare from traveling third class; it hits the poor, not because it wants to hurt them, but to frighten the rich. Effective fencing requires adequate gaps in value across the price categories. It is not the maximum price differentiation that is optimal, but rather the extent that strikes the best balance between value and costs. It will become more and more difficult to implement differentiated prices for identical products and services. Customers are simply too well informed and when in doubt they can buy the product elsewhere at a lower price. All multidimensional price structures contain some form of price differentiation, because the fixed price gets allocated across different volume levels. An advantage of these systems is that a company makes the same price offer to all customers, but each customer pays a different amount according to his or her own actual usage. The goal of a freemium model is to use the free price to attract the largest number of potential customers. The company hopes that if the user becomes comfortable with the basic functionality, he or she will have a growing interest in paying for a version which is more powerful, and more advanced, or offers additional functionality. Freemium fits very well to experience goods, whose full value only becomes apparent when customers have had a chance to use the good. The largest hurdle in freemium models is getting customers over this initial price barrier, or getting them to cross the “penny gap The largest hurdle in freemium models is getting customers over this initial price barrier, or getting them to cross the “penny gap .” The challenge for the publishers is to draw customers away from the “free” culture and to establish their digital content as a paid experience. A systematic optimization of price and product using a freemium model typically increases revenues by about 20 %, according to Simon-Kucher & Partners ’ experience. The music group Radiohead released its album In Rainbows online in 2007 with a “pay what you want” model. The album was downloaded over one million times, with 40 % of the “buyers” paying an average price of $6 apiece. In short: businesses should avoid “pay what you want ” systems. Instead of perpetuating these revenue-based plans, I strongly recommend that companies switch to profit-oriented incentive plans. In making that switch, companies do not need to sacrifice simplicity or confidentiality. One simple approach is to link the commission or incentive to the level of discount. The lower the discounts a salesperson grants, the higher his or her commission. Surcharges are an appropriate way to take advantage of higher willingness to pay in peak periods. A passenger railroad could introduce surcharges for travel on Friday afternoons or on Sunday evenings. These surcharges would have two effects: they would increase the company’s profits and also damp demand, which lowers the chances that trains will be overbooked or overfilled in those peak travel times. Price cuts in off-peak periods often have little effect, but price increases in peak periods can have a significant effect. We see these kinds of asymmetries in time-based price differentiation in a number of industries. Often the value of a product depends on how quickly it becomes available or how quickly a customer can access it. Under normal circumstances, managers tend to show a preference for a “lower prices, constant volume” alternative, but this tendency becomes more pronounced in a time of crisis. The effort to keep sales and capacity utilization up, and keep people at work, takes precedence. But in a time of crisis, that can be precisely the wrong approach. The same principle applies to renting, not just to purchases. In general, it is more advantageous for a lessor to offer a new tenant several months of free rent instead of a discounted price per square foot. The biggest challenge facing pricing in the modern world is overcapacity As long as this root cause remains unaddressed or unresolved, any changes companies make are just doctoring with symptoms rather than finding lasting cures. The path to rational, reasonable, profitable prices often requires the elimination of excess capacity. I summarize my insights into price wars very simply: there are smart industries and there are self-destructive industries. What is the difference? The smart ones avoid price wars, and the self-destructive ones get stuck in them. The smart ones are profitable; the self-destructive ones incur losses or destroy profits. The problem is that it only takes one self-destructive competitor to render an entire industry self-destructive. That’s why it is better to have smart competitors. I advised him to repeat the “profit” mantra every day, as often as possible. He of course will hear the message every time he says it, but others hear it only once or twice and won’t get tired of it. Pursue price leadership through a consistent communication campaign emphasizing the importance of price and value. “Good pricing has three prerequisites: create value, quantify value, and communicate value,” I said in summary. “That is when you get the price you deserve, the price you need for a profitable business. And, last but not least, avoid price wars. Profit maximization is the only sensible goal for pricing. Pricing belongs on the CEO ’s desk."
"Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond","Some environments provide more starting materials and more favorable conditions for utilizing inventions and building societies than other environments. This is particularly notable in the rise of European peoples, which occurred because of environmental differences and not because of biological differences in the people themselves. There are four primary reasons Europeans rose to power and conquered the natives of North and South America, and not the other way around: 1) the continental differences in the plants and animals available for domestication, which led to more food and larger populations in Europe and Asia, 2) the rate of diffusion of agriculture, technology and innovation due to the geographic orientation of Europe and Asia (east-west) compared to the Americas (north-south), 3) the ease of intercontinental diffusion between Europe, Asia, and Africa, and 4) the differences in continental size, which led to differences in total population size and technology diffusion.","History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences in their environments not because of biological differences in the people themselves. This book seeks to answer the question, “Why did the rate of progress differ so much for cultures on different continents?” Around 11,000 years ago all human societies were hunter gatherers. Understanding the causes of history improves our ability to intervene and improve the world. Many people mistakenly assume that discussing history is just a way to explain away tough issues. Not at all. It improves our ability to take effective action. The most common explanation of the different trajectories experienced by Europe compared to Africa, Asia, Oceania, etc. is genetic and biological. People assume there is some innate biological difference that made Europeans smarter, more creative, or more resilient. Science, however, has produced no substantial evidence to indicate this is the primary cause of different outcomes. Interesting side note: scientists are always competing to discover the “earliest human remains” or the earliest XYZ. As a result, every few years there is a new “earliest” discovery. Only one can actually be the earliest, of course. The occupation of Australia was an incredible feat. It was the first use of water craft and range extension by humans. Humans were likely responsible for the extinction of nearly all of Australia's large mammals. The same is true for many large mammals that occupied the Americas over 10,000 years ago. The environment of ancient Polynesian society heavily dictated the lifestyle and behaviors. The many islands have widely varying landscapes and climates. Whether or not cultures developed weapons and became skilled at warfare, whether they became hunter gatherers or farmers, whether they acted more tribal or more hierarchical was largely determined by the environment in which these people lived. Food and animal domestication arose independently in five different areas of the world (at widely differing times) and possibly four others although there is still some contention about those. We often think there is a clear division between farmer and hunter gatherer lifestyles, but actually there can be a blending of the two. For example, some cultures plant crops, resume a hunter gatherer lifestyle while they grow, then return to harvest and eat. Agriculture did not lead to an unequivocally better lifestyle. In fact, for those who actually grow food life tends to be worse than it would be as a hunter gatherer. If this is true, and the evidence seems to point that way, then it means that advancement of civilization has essentially happened on the backs of society's have-nots. In other words, the entire system we live within – agriculture, capitalism, etc. – requires inequality to function. Agriculture allowed food production per unit area to increase, which meant a given area could support a larger population. This allowed farming cultures to defeat hunter gatherer cultures by sheer force due to larger populations. This, in turn, led to the spread of more agricultural societies across the globe. Throughout the industrial revolution in Great Britain, moths of darker colors became more likely to survive because the surrounding environment become dirtier and covered in soot, smoke, and debris. Thus, it was more likely that dark-colored moths would survive than light-colored moths. As the environment changed, so did the evolution of moths. A fascinating example of evolution on a small scale. Cereal crops alone account for more than half of the food consumed by modern humans. The rise of indigenous food production in certain areas was the result of a few factors. First, certain areas had plants better suited to domestication. This led people to domestic earlier in those regions. Second, because of this early start, these people eventually domesticated more difficult plants. Evidence seems to indicate that all people's are capable of food production and even modern hunter gatherers seem to be naturally moving that way. The rise of agriculture in some areas before others has to do with the environment, not the intelligence of the people. The Anna Karenina Principle: In many areas of life, success is not about doing one thing correctly, but about avoiding many possible modes of failure. Domesticated animals differ in multiple ways from their wild ancestors. For example, many domesticated animals are different sizes and have smaller brains than their wild ancestors. Domestication of large mammals ended approximately 4500 years ago. This indicates humans attempted to domesticate all of them and no suitable species remained. This is another piece of evidence that the type of animals available dictated the domestication in certain regions, not the people living in the region. This the spread of agriculture was once again impacted by the environment. There is a inefficiency during the eating process. The nutrient transfer is much less than 100 percent and typically around 10 percent. For example, it takes 10,000 pounds of corn to create a 1,000 pound bull. The primary geographic axis of North and South America is north-south. That is, the land mass is more longitudinal than latitudinal. The same for Africa. But for Europe and Asia, the primary axis is east-west. Interestingly, this positioning and shape matters greatly because it appears that agriculture and innovations spread more rapidly along east-west axes than along north-south axes. Locations along the same east-west axis share similar latitudes and thus have similar day lengths, seasons, climate, rainfalls, and biomes. All of which increase the speed of innovation relative to north-south axes. All tropical rainforests are within 10 degrees of latitude of the equator. One collection of evidence for the difference in spread along geographic axes is the spread of domesticated crops. Many crops spread across Asia with one domestication, while crops like cotton or squash were domesticated in multiple individual areas throughout Mesoamerica. This is because the crop spread too slowly for one domestication to takeover the region. It is vital to realize that although Diamond is discussing long time frames of hundreds or thousands of years, the core idea can be applied to short time spans of individual behavior as well. Indeed, large long term differences only occur because short term differences are repeated over and over again. Small environmental differences led to small changes in individual behavior, which resulted in significant differences when repeated for thousands of years. One reason farming communities developed immunity to diseases that wiped out hunter gatherer populations is that some diseases (like measles) are “crowd diseases.” They require a large population to sustain themselves because they act quickly: you either die or develop immunity. In order for the disease to sustain itself there must be enough new babies born to contract the disease from those who have already developed immunity. Only agricultural communities could grow to the required population size. On average, farming sustains populations that are 10x to 100x larger than hunting and gathering. North America was populated by about 20 million Native Americans when Columbus landed in 1492. Within two centuries, 95 percent of the native population had died, most of them from infectious diseases. Writing systems are historically seen as the deciding factor on whether an ancients civilization is considered advanced or not. This can be debated. The Incas built a great civilization without writing. All alphabets in the modern world evolved from one original alphabet, either in idea or actual written form, developed in the Middle East. Writing evolved independently in a few areas, but was spread via idea diffusion in most cultures and locations. Most inventions are not a result of necessity, but rather the result of tinkers and curiosity. Technology develops cumulatively rather than in isolated heroic acts. Even people we often associate with acts of genius like the Wright Brothers and Thomas Edison actually built upon the work of predecessors and had capable people who followed them and advanced ideas. Technology finds most of its uses after it has been invented rather than being invented to solve a foreseen need. The phrase, “necessity is the mother of invention” is generally incorrect. (Even though some examples, like the Manhattan Project, exist.) Long life expectancy is one reason technology might develop and spread faster in some locations rather than others. A longer life increases the surface area you have to test ideas and allows you to take on longer projects that you might otherwise avoid with limited time. Geographic location is a key determinant in the pace of technological innovation and acceleration because a centrally located society will not only accumulate knowledge and technology from their own inventions, but also from neighboring societies. In the case of a particularly large land mass like Eurasia, technologies can spread from one culture to another and continue to do so along the entire span of the continent. This spread occurs much more quickly in these locations than it would to, say, aboriginal cultures in Tasmania, which did not receive outside contact from other civilizations for over 10,000 years. Government and religion are two of the main reasons some societies overcame others. These shared myths led to collaboration and increased power. There are four levels of organization in society: bands (5-80 people), tribes (100-1000 people),  chiefdoms (1000 to tens of thousands of people), and states (50,000 or more people). Humanity has been on a clear path from small groups to larger ones, culminating in states, over the last few thousand years. The size of a population in a region is a strong predictor of the complexity of the society. Culture is heavily dependent on population density. The higher the population, the more culture seems to spawn and spread. War, or the threat of war, is the primary factor in the amalgamation of human societies throughout history. It is how cultures merge. Five dog night is an Australian phrase referring to a very cold night because you would need to use five dogs as blankets. Isolation is a key factor preventing creativity and innovation from spreading because most people and societies get their ideas from outside societies. So constant connection to others and trading of ideas and resources is essential for technological and creative progress. Food production was a key component in the determining the strength of a society. People sharing similar ancestors inhabited New Guinea and Indonesia, but the Indonesians were still hunter gatherers while the New Guineans had develop agriculture. When Austronesians invaded the region, Indonesians fell under their control, but New Guineas (with their food, germ resistance, and technologies) were able to resist. Again and again, the environment dictated the spread of power throughout islands of East Asia and the Pacific. Depending on location, islanders differed in their connectedness to other peoples and in the plants and animals available to them to domesticate. People with favorable locations for food production and access to technology replaced those with less favorable environments. The end of Chapter 18 shares multiple interesting examples of peoples who were largely similar genetically because of similar ancestors, but developed very different societies and technologies due to the their individual environments. Example of cultural evolution: the Moari of New Zealand were able to determine the most useful rocks and animals for domestication within a century of arriving. The striking differences in the histories of peoples on different continents have been due not to differences among the peoples themselves, but to differences in their environments. There are four primary reasons Europeans rose to power and conquered the natives of North and South America, and not the other way around. Reason 1: Continental differences in the plants and animals available for domestication. The differences are vast. Europe and Asia had the best prospects, then Africa, then the Americas, then Australia. The improved agricultural aspects led to larger populations and larger armies in Europe and Asia. Reason 2: the rate of diffusion of technological innovation due to the orientation of continents (east-west vs. north-south) and geographic barriers (mountains, deserts, etc.). The favorable geography of the Europe and Asia landmass resulted in much faster agricultural and technological expansion. Reason 3: ease of intercontinental diffusion. It was easy for ideas, technologies, and innovations to spread between Europe, Asia, and Africa. However, it was quite difficult for things to spread to the Americas because of large oceans and the only close landmass being in cold climates and at high latitudes unsuitable for farming. Reason 4: continental differences in total population size. Europe and Asia had a huge landmass where there was constant and widespread competition. All human societies contain inventive people. It's just that some environments provide more starting materials and more favorable conditions for utilizing inventions than other environments. The fragmentation of Europe was a key in enabling Columbus to cross the Atlantic. He was turned down by four different kingdoms before finally convincing the king and queen of Spain to fund his trip. Meanwhile, Chona had the technology to explore the world by ship, but their dictator at the time did not want to do so. In this way, one person prevented an entire made of people (with the technology) from succeeding. A little fragmentation is good. Too much centralized power means one person can handcuff the creativity of many. In the 1960s and 1970s, the decisions of a few Chinese leaders resulted in the schools closing in the country for five years. Crazy how so much centralized power is still playing a huge role. Europe has always been far more fragmented than China. Even at its peak, the Roman Empire never controlled more than half of Europe. Understanding ultimate causes is essential to understanding human behavior. Prediction of history is much easier over long time spans, but basically impossible over short time spans. Great discussion of science in the last half of the epilogue. Careful observations of natural experiments (things happening in the real world) can lead to fascinating and useful insights. Epidemiology, ecology, and evolutionary biology are developing better methods for dealing with the confounding factors often present in natural experiments."
Incognito by David Eagleman,Conscious thought has a surprisingly small impact on your life and most of your behaviors are driven by the unconscious mind. There are competing beliefs within your unconscious mind that are all battling for the single output of your conscious behavior. The complex interactions between your genetics and your environment determine the trajectory of your life.,"Your brains is built of cells called neurons and glia. Each cell sends electrical pulses to other cells. A typical neuron makes about 10,000 connections to other neurons. There are more connections in one cubic centimeter of the brain than there are stars in the Milky Way. Thoughts don't seem like physical things. They don't seem like they exist in a tangible form, but that's exactly what is going on. The physical structure of the brain determines the thoughts that flow from it. Men in a study voted pictures of women with dilated pupils as more attractive than those without. Consciousness is the smallest player of our mind. Most of our brain operates in a hidden mode. Your conscious mind is like a newspaper. It delivers headlines but rarely show you what's going on behind the scenes. When you say, “I just got an idea!” You are actually referencing all sorts of work your brain has been doing behind the scenes for minutes, days, or months. “In each of us there is another who we do not know.” -Carl Jung First of all, you have to realize that conscious thought should NOT be involved in most decisions and actions. If you had to decide every damn thing you would never get anything done. Conscious awareness takes about 0.5 seconds. Hitting a baseball takes 0.4 seconds. It's literally impossible to consciously hit a baseball. Your brain makes the choice to hit and swing with unconscious information. Bruno was burned to death with an iron mask on his face to prevent him from speaking eloquently and firing up the crowd. Interesting story about the power of ideas. There is a concept that a conscious idea is actually a collection of signals your brain picks up that all point in the same direction. Once the signal becomes strong enough, it becomes a conscious thought. If you brain gets a signal that points one way and another pointing a different way, then they sort of cancel one another out. It's like the brain needs enough unconscious votes before it generates a conscious thought. I like the concept of your mind as an iceberg. Conscious thought is just the visible tip. Unconscious thought is the mass beneath the water. The only way society functions is by groups of people consciously focusing on things. Whether I'm on a plane or not, I never think about pre-flight procedures, how much gas is in the plane, whether the landing gear is working well, and so on. (By the way, if you're on a plane right now–my apologies.) but I don't need to think about those things because someone else is consciously focused on them. This is how we build well-functioning teams and societies. We are all running on autopilot in nearly every area of life, but each of us has the capacity to be consciously focused on a few things. Divide those areas of focus up in smart ways and you get a really effective team. We are astoundingly poor observers of our own experience. (Reminds me of the gorilla video experiment. This is called “change blindness.”) One-third of the human brain is allocated to vision. It's interesting to note: your vision is simply a cone of vision where you point your eyes. We all live our lives by viewing only the world of vision that is inside this little cone… without even realizing it. The brain is organized like a marketplace, not an assembly line. Even tasks that are historically depicted at a straight line (vision, for example) are actually the result of a network or inputs (vision is impacted not just by light, but also by sounds, etc.). This means that the entire world as you know it is not a simple series of cause and effect relationships. Rather, there are many tiny causes that build into some final effect. There are many bits of information that impact vision. (If this is true, then there are many bits of information that impact behavior.) Chicken sexing is really hard, but the best in the world are in Japan. Male and female chicks look almost exactly the same at 1 day old. They trained new chicken sexers by trial and error feedback … Even though they couldn't explain how they did it. It's unconsciously learned. There is a really cool research test covered in chapter 3 that helps identify your internal biases. Are you biased toward certain religions, genders, races, body types, etc? It could be very interesting to take this, uncover your hidden biases, and then take active steps to reduce those biases. People tend to love reflections of themselves in others and on products. This is called “implicit egotism.” We like people who share our birthdays, have names similar to our, and so on. People named Denise or Dennis are disproportionally likely to be dentists. The mere exposure effect proves that our brains tend to like things that we are exposed to often. Similarly, we tend to associate two things with one another if we hear that pairing often. (This reminds me of people who say they have “great networks” over and over. Eventually, you associate the two things together and you're like “That guy is a great networker! He has tons of amazing contacts.” Mere exposure effect at work — and with hustle on that guys part it can become a reality too.) It can be a very good idea to “trust your gut” because a variety of studies have shown that your unconscious mind knows the correct decision before your conscious mind does. We make decisions consciously and then begin to automate them and follow them unconsciously. Humans have an incredible ability to learn and, with enough practice, mindlessly automate almost any skill. We are designed and hard-wired to like certain animals (humans), foods (fruits, veggies, rtf.), and even thoughts. For example, we only see a small portion of the light spectrum (visible light and not infrared, for example). Our biology determines our reality. We accept the reality presented to us. And this reality is constructed by our brains, not merely interpreted by our brains. Reality is far more subjective than we suppose. Social behavior is wired into our brains. We are born with a tendency for social behavior. We are least aware of what our mind does best. Our instincts are often blind to us. They are burned down so deep into our genetic code that we don't even notice them. William James said we have more instincts than other animals, not less. And this is why we are flexible thinkers. We often assume instinct is low level thinking, but in fact it has millions of years of evolution built into it. The benefit of instinct is speed and automatic behavior. The cost is failure to notice them. We are unable to see the instincts that drove our behavior. They are so critical, they are subconscious. The more simple something seems, the more neural circuitry there usually is behind it. Research shows that women are deemed most beautiful by men and women at the peak of their menstrual cycle (10 days before menses). These changes in a female's appearance are incredibly subtle, but they only need to be enough to trigger the unconscious realization by partners to work. It's not quite clear what the tip offs are (ears and breasts become more symmetrical, for example). Women are particularly sensitive to other women's cycles. Perhaps due to competition? Researchers found that strippers earned more at the peak of their cycle ($68/hr average) than when menstrating ($35/hr average). The human mind runs on conflict. There are competing beliefs within your unconscious mind that are all battling for the single output of your conscious behavior. Reason wants one thing. Emotion wants another. But they both think they have the right way of solving the problems they face. The brain is made of competing subsystems. For example, system one and system two. System one is automatic and heuristic. System two is conscious and analytical. The neuroanatomy of your brain maps roughly with system one and system two. Rational cognition involves external events. Emotional cognition is about your internal state. Emotion (or lack of emotion) often tips the scales of our behavior. Kahneman and Tversky's famous studies on discounting ($100 now vs $110 in one week compared to $100 in 52 weeks vs $110 in 53 weeks) were investigated by neuroscientists. They found that immediate payoffs activated the emotional centers of the brain (impulsive behavior) while long-term rewards activated areas of higher cognition (rational behavior). Your behavior is simply the end result of the battles between short and long-term desires. Some philosophers refer to commitment devices as Ulysses Contracts after the famous story about Ulysses and the Sirens. Our brain is a highly overlapping and redundant system. That is, various parts of the brain can accomplish similar tasks. Possible countermeasure against Alzheimers: Cognitive Reserve. This is a term scientists use to describe why some people have brains that were ravaged by Alzheimers but never showed symptoms. By challenging their brain and staying mentally active, these people developed multiple pathways for solving the same problems. Alzheimers might prevent one approach, but you still have other pathways. This cognitive reserve counteracted the Alzheimers symptoms. When part of the brain degrades it was not even missed because of alternative solutions. Brains seek patterns. In many ways, our brains are wired to create meaning from meaningless data. Dreams illustrate our skills at generating a narrative from unrelated pieces of information. Research by Pennebaker: studies or rape victims have shown that not discussing your problems (keeping secrets) might lead to more harm than the event itself. Biology and brain research has revealed that instead of asking, “What's the best way to solve that problem?” We should ask, “Are there multiple, overlapping ways to solve that problem?” Who you have the probability to be starts at conception. For example, the Y chromosome leads to an increase in criminal behavior of more than 800 percent. The majority of prisoners carry these genes as well as 98.4 percent of inmates on death row. If you are make, you are predisposed to violence. When an accident happens with animal handlers (a lion attacks a tamer, for example), we often refer to the fact that it is an animal. What were you expecting an animal to do? But humans are animals too. And yet, we often assume that people are rational brings that would not resort to animalistic behavior. We assume that humans have free will. That assumption may be wrong. Given the current state of research nobody can find a way around the lack of free will. If free will exists, then it must appear somewhere in the brain. But there are no free sections of the brain. Every section of the brain is connected to other parts of the brain. Research by Lippet: ran the famous study on free will which sparked the idea that our conscious mind was the last one to know what we are doing. According to the author, it doesn't matter whether or not we have free will. Acts cannot be separated from our biology. Societies will always need to get bad actors off the streets. A lack of free will does not mean there is no need for our justice system. Our perceptions and behaviors are controlled by hidden, neurobiological factors. There is no distinction between “his biology” and “him.” They are one in the same. Research by Steven Laconte and Pearl Chu: you look at a picture of chocolate cake. A screen displays a vertical bar that shows the areas of brain activity present during your craving. Then, you try various strategies to make the bar go down. When it does, you are effectively decreasing the activity of the brain that causes cravings. This “pre-frontal workout” helps you strengthen your circuitry to combat cravings. The complex web of genetics and environment constructs the trajectory of human life. The conscious mind is not the one driving the boat. We are the sum total of our neurobiology. What we think of as “him” or “her” is really the average or that person's neurobiological chemicals (and resulting behaviors) over time. The personalities we think of as ourselves are time averaged versions of our neurobiology. Huntington's disease is the result of a change to a single gene, but it is an outlier. Most genetic diseases are the result of subtle changes and interactions across many genes. (So even our DNA is the result of many small changes.) The contributions of the genome to our behavior can only be understood in the context of interactions with the environment. Research by Avshalom Caspi: they looked at gene-environment interactions and depression and found a bit of a link. Environmental effects can multiply the impact of biology and genes. Our behavior is both nature and nurture. Although our biology underpins everything about us, we cannot reduce the human experience to a collection of molecules and atoms. Why? Because of the concept of emergence. Just as the ability to fly emerges from pieces of metal in a plane, the ability to think emerges from our atoms. And we don't yet understand how this beautiful mystery works."
Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It by Kamal Ravikant,"Everyone has a truth that they need to live and share. For the author, that truth was committing to the daily practice of repeating the phrase “I love myself.” When you love yourself, life loves you back.","Share your truth. Whatever your truth is, live it. Share it. James Altucher: “I don’t do a post now unless I’m worried about what people will think about me.” In simplicity lies truth. In simplicity lies power. This is a practice. You don’t go to the gym once and consider yourself done. Loving yourself is a practice. During a dark time in his life when he was feeling incredibly stressed and even depressed, the author kept repeating to himself day and night, “I love myself.” His mantra became his anchor. The one true thing in his life. He kept repeating it until it surprised himself doing it automatically. “Imagine the feeling of catching yourself loving yourself without even realizing you were doing it.” What if you don’t believe it? Doesn’t matter. Your role is to lay down the pathway for doing it. Connect the neurons and your body and mind will respond automatically. As you love yourself, life loves you back. There are three steps to gently return himself to self-love each day: 1) Mental loop, 2) Meditation, 3) One Question. If you loved yourself truly and deeply, would you limit your life to what you previously thought possible? Nope. You would blow your own socks off. What if you don’t love yourself or even like yourself? Just remain open to the possibility of loving yourself. The rest is easy. Darkness is simply the absence of light. You can’t push darkness away. You can’t hide from it. Similarly, you can’t hide from depression, anxiety, self-hate, and more. And you don’t need to. The only thing you need to do is turn a light on. To let the sun shine in through the window. Whenever you feel like you are in darkness, just let light in through the window. You don’t need to escape or destroy the darkness. Just let in the light. Step 1: Mental Loop A thought loop is a pathway laid down by constant use. With enough time and intensity, if you repeat it again and again, you start to create a mental river that controls you. You believe it is automatic and the reality you live in, but really it is just a mental loop you have repeated too many times. You can reverse this process. You can create your own focused mental loops. Repeat, “I love myself” again and again and again. Lay the pathway for that loop to run over and over. Eventually, it will take hold whether you believe it or not. You need to create a groove that is deeper than those unhappy and unhelpful grooves you’ve laid down over the years. Step 2: Meditation Each day, the author listens to a 7-minute piece of music that he likes and thinks, “I love myself.” Pattern: Inhale > Think “I love myself” > Exhale > Let out whatever thoughts you have. Step 3: Question “If I love myself truly and deeply, would I let myself experience this?” The answer was always “no” for the author. This question gently shifts your focus from wherever you are to self-love. Can you say, “I’m in love” and have it simply be with yourself? Of course you can. If you love yourself, you naturally shine. You get a spring in your step and your smile comes out. Beautiful irony: fall in love with yourself and naturally express yourself and the world will beat a path to your door to fall in love with you. The more you think about it, the more you feel it, the stronger the memory. The more you recall something, the more it strengthens. The emotions you focus on are the same. The more you focus on negative aspects of your memory, the more they take control. They more you focus on the positive thoughts and loving yourself, the more they take control. Most of what we fear is not useful and not real. When fear arises your job is to remind yourself of this. “Not useful. Not real. Continue on.” Don’t let yourself coast when things are going great. “It’s easy to wish for your health when you’re sick. But you need to be just as vigilant when things are going great.” If you love yourself truly and deeply, you’ll commit to the practice. You won’t get lazy when things are going well. Loving yourself is like putting your oxygen mask on before helping the person next to you. Loving yourself softens your own ego. Fear hardens your ego. It’s easier to be helpful and kind when you love yourself. Instead of reading loads of self-help books, we should just focus on one thing. Put all our energy toward that. And place a bet on one thing. For the author, that one thing is “I love myself.” The one key that makes all of this work is this: make the vow. Make the commitment and make it on paper. Make the vow to yourself to live your truth. Write down whatever it is that speaks to you. The words don’t matter. Just make sure it comes from you and it is in your own words. That’s how the magic will happen."
Mastermind Dinners by Jayson Gaignard,Hosting dinners with like-minded people is one of the most powerful way to build fantastic relationships in business and in life. You should think carefully about who you invite to these meals and look for uncommon commonalities that make it more likely the guests will resonate with one another. Be the gatekeeper of your network and assume responsibility for the people you surround yourself with in life.,"Jayson spent $600-$800 per dinner in the beginning. Seems like he usually had about 8 people at each dinner. “You need to surround yourself with people who are batteries, not black holes.” “A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle.” Many things in life, and especially relationship-building and success, are not fixed pie situations. “Would you be friends with yourself?” That is, what makes you interesting? Three types of dinners: 1) Reconnecting old ties. 2) Connecting people who should know each other. 3) Connecting with people who I’ve meant to connect with for a long time. Be very conscious of the synergy of the group. Develop a “go to” restaurant on a regular basis. One good strategy: hold dinners around an event (like WDS) because 1) you catch people on the road, which means they are probably free that night and 2) like-minded people often hang out at the same events. Another option: throw an event for speakers (if you’re speaking at an event yourself) There should be at least one commonality around all guests (entrepreneurs, artists, etc.) Don’t select people at opposite extremes of that commonality (i.e. Don’t have someone running a $100M startup and someone just starting their first venture.) Don’t select people who are competitors. You want the whole room to feel collaborative. Jayson prefers dinners of 4-6 people. In a group of 5, you may want to sit at the end and play more of a facilitator role. If you have 6 people, you may want a roundtable setup. And you’ll definitely want to play a facilitator role because one or two people may tend to dominate the conversation. In a group of 8 or more, you’ll need a private dining room. The downside of this is that there are multiple conversations going on and people may feel lost and left out of conversations going on at the other side of the table. Avoid trying to reach other people cold. Get warm intros. It will massively improve the success rate of invitations. Always check FB and LinkedIn for common connections. (Also, ask your network for help with intros.) “Friends! I’m traveling to San Diego for the week. Who should I connect with while I’m in town?” (This is a great way to get intros.) You can try two strategies for getting people to say yes to these dinners: First, “work your way up the food chain” by getting smaller players to say yes first and then going slowly up the food chain to bigger names. Second, you can try to land one big name to start and then use that credibility to pull everyone else in. Before you do any kind of outreach to a big name, question your motives. Why this person? Are there other people who could help you reach the same outcome? “It would be much easier to reach a silver medalist than Michael Phelps.” Always ask yourself, “What is in it for this person?” Why would they want to attend this dinner? Put a lot of effort into personalizing your approach. People respond to effort. Subject lines in invitation emails are really important. Some examples: 1) “Hey Tim, I’m in town…” 2) “Adam told me to reach out to you…” 3) “Jon, I’m doing a dinner with a group of entrepreneurs…” Using the person’s name in the email title is great. “The shorter the response a prospect needs to give, the better.” Start with a small ask. Your only goal is to get a discussion going. “Hey Steve, I’m hosting a dinner with a group of entrepreneurs, are you interested?” YESWARE for Gmail. It confirms that an email has been opened. How to handle an someone turning down your invite: “Under what circumstances would you say, “Yes.”? How to choose the perfect restaurant. Get a restaurant that is vegetarian and paleo friendly. If you develop a great working relationship with a particular restaurant, you can get a kickback, a private room, or a discount. Do your research again before the dinner. The more you know about the people you are dealing with, the better you can serve their needs and ask relevant questions. Dan Martell’s idea: he sits in the middle of the table so that he can act as “conversation cop” and pull people in as needed. He also tries to place the most interesting or extroverted person in the middle of the group, so conversation doesn’t skew to one side. The day of the dinner: arrive 30-60 minutes in advance. Especially important to select the best table if you haven’t been able to book the table in advance. You can order whatever you want. If we’re ordering wine, always order by the glass. State an end time in advance. “The dinner is done by 9:30, but everyone is allowed to stay longer if they want.” The more open and vulnerable you are during your intro, the more others will follow suit. His favorite opener: Thorns, Roses, and Buds. “Something that is going well, something that has the potential to turn into something good, and something that is going poorly.” Conversation starters: http://www.masterminddinners.com/ice-breakers/ Take a picture of the group! Introduce the group via email afterward. Also, include a resource list in the follow up email based on what people bring up in conversation at the dinner. If people follow up with you after the dinner and say, “How can I repay you?” Or, “How can I give value back?” Then, take them up on the offer and ask for an introduction to one additional amazing person that would love to be at a future dinner. Be the gatekeeper of your network: If you’re asked to do introductions, then always get “double opt-in” from both people. There should be a strong and compelling outcome to each intro. Ask people, “What is your desired outcome from this connection?”"
On the Shortness of Life by Seneca,"We all fear death, but life is long if you know how to use it. Putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future: live immediately. In any situation in life you will find delights and relaxations and pleasures if you are prepared to make light of your troubles and not let them distress you.","It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. We are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it. Just as when ample and princely wealth falls to a bad owner it is squandered in a moment, but wealth however modest, if entrusted to a good custodian, increases with use, so our lifetime extends amply if you manage it properly. Life is long if you know how to use it. You will find no one willing to share out his money; but to how many does each of us divide up his life! People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time they are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy. You are living as if destined to live for ever; your own frailty never occurs to you; you don’t notice how much time has already passed, but squander it as though you had a full and overflowing supply – though all the while that very day which you are devoting to somebody or something may be your last. You will hear many people saying: ‘When I am fifty I shall retire into leisure; when I am sixty I shall give up public duties.’ And what guarantee do you have of a longer life? Who will allow your course to proceed as you arrange it? Aren’t you ashamed to keep for yourself just the remnants of your life, and to devote to wisdom only that time which cannot be spent on any business? How late it is to begin really to live just when life must end! How stupid to forget our mortality, and put off sensible plans to our fiftieth and sixtieth years, aiming to begin life from a point at which few have arrived! No activity can be successfully pursued by an individual who is preoccupied. Living is the least important activity of the preoccupied man; yet there is nothing which is harder to learn. For being an extremely thrifty guardian of his time he never found anything for which it was worth exchanging. Everyone hustles his life along, and is troubled by a longing for the future and weariness of the present. But the man who spends all his time on his own needs, who organizes every day as though it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the next day. You must not think a man has lived long because he has white hair and wrinkles: he has not lived long, just existed long. Each of us could have the tally of his future years set before him, as we can of our past years, how alarmed would be those who saw only a few years ahead, and how carefully would they use them! Life will follow the path it began to take, and will neither reverse nor check its course. It will cause no commotion to remind you of its swiftness, but glide on quietly. It will not lengthen itself for a king’s command or a people’s favour. As it started out on its first day, so it will run on, nowhere pausing or turning aside. What will be the outcome? You have been preoccupied while life hastens on. Meanwhile death will arrive, and you have no choice in making yourself available for that. But putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future. The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately. Life is divided into three periods, past, present and future. Of these, the present is short, the future is doubtful, the past is certain. Some men are preoccupied even in their leisure: in their country house, on their couch, in the midst of solitude, even when quite alone, they are their own worst company. You could not call theirs a life of leisure, but an idle preoccupation. Again, do you call those men leisured who spend many hours at the barber’s simply to cut whatever grew overnight, to have a serious debate about every separate hair, to tidy up disarranged locks or to train thinning ones from the sides to lie over the forehead. 
Notes: 1) Ha. How interesting that they tried to hide baldness back then too. On the value of reading and writing philosophy: This is the only way to prolong mortality – even to convert it to immortality. Honours, monuments, whatever the ambitious have ordered by decrees or raised in public buildings are soon destroyed: there is nothing that the passage of time does not demolish and remove. But it cannot damage the works which philosophy has consecrated: no age will wipe them out, no age diminish them. The next and every following age will only increase the veneration for them, since envy operates on what is at hand, but we can more openly admire things from a distance. So the life of the philosopher extends widely: he is not confined by the same boundary as are others. Life is very short and anxious for those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear the future. It is inevitable that life will be not just very short but very miserable for those who acquire by great toil what they must keep by greater toil. There will always be causes for anxiety, whether due to prosperity or to wretchedness. In this kind of life you will find much that is worth your study: the love and practice of the virtues, forgetfulness of the passions, the knowledge of how to live and die, and a life of deep tranquillity. Everlasting misfortune does have one blessing, that it ends up by toughening those whom it constantly afflicts. I’m afraid that habit, which induces firmness in things, may drive this fault more deeply into me: long association brings love of evil as well as good. Let no one rob me of a single day who is not going to make me an adequate return for such a loss. Bias always affects our judgment. I imagine many people could have achieved wisdom if they had not imagined they had already achieved it, if they had not dissembled about some of their own characteristics and turned a blind eye to others. There are those too who suffer not from moral steadfastness but from inertia, and so lack the fickleness to live as they wish, and just live as they have begun. We must realize that our difficulty is not the fault of the places but of ourselves. We are weak in enduring anything, and cannot put up with toil or pleasure or ourselves or anything for long. Often a very old man has no other proof of his long life than his age. I would not deny that one has to yield sometimes – but by a gradual retreat, and holding on to our standards and our soldier’s honour. Truly, I believe, Curius Dentatus used to say that he preferred real death to living death; for the ultimate horror is to leave the number of the living before you die. You must consider whether your nature is more suited to practical activity or to quiet study and reflection, and incline in the direction your natural faculty and disposition take you. But nothing delights the mind so much as fond and loyal friendship. What a blessing it is to have hearts that are ready and willing to receive all your secrets in safety, with whom you are less afraid to share knowledge of something than keep it to yourself, whose conversation soothes your distress, whose advice helps you make up your mind, whose cheerfulness dissolves your sorrow, whose very appearance cheers you up! You must especially avoid those who are gloomy and always lamenting, and who grasp at every pretext for complaint. Though a man’s loyalty and kindness may not be in doubt, a companion who is agitated and groaning about everything is an enemy to peace of mind. It is easier to bear and simpler not to acquire than to lose, so you will notice that those people are more cheerful whom Fortune has never favoured than those whom she has deserted. Yet when Diogenes was told that his only slave had run away, he did not think it worth the trouble to get him back. ‘It would be degrading,’ he said, ‘if Manes can live without Diogenes and not Diogenes without Manes.’ How much happier is the man who owes nothing to anybody except the one he can most easily refuse, himself! What is the point of having countless books and libraries whose titles the owner could scarcely read through in his whole lifetime? The mass of books burdens the student without instructing him, and it is far better to devote yourself to a few authors than to get lost among many. In any situation in life you will find delights and relaxations and pleasures if you are prepared to make light of your troubles and not let them distress you. So you have to get used to your circumstances, complain about them as little as possible, and grasp whatever advantage they have to offer: no condition is so bitter that a stable mind cannot find some consolation in it. Think your way through difficulties: harsh conditions can be softened, restricted ones can be widened, and heavy ones can weigh less on those who know how to bear them. Should Nature demand back what she previously entrusted to us we shall say to her too: ‘Take back my spirit in better shape than when you gave it. I do not quibble or hang back: I am willing for you to have straightway what you gave me before I was conscious – take it.’ What is the harm in returning to the point whence you came? He will live badly who does not know how to die well. So we must first strip off the value we set on this thing and reckon the breath of life as something cheap. To quote Cicero, we hate gladiators if they are keen to save their life by any means; we favour them if they openly show contempt for it. You must realize that the same thing applies to us: for often the cause of dying is the fear of it. He who fears death will never do anything worthy of a living man. But he who knows that this was the condition laid down for him at the moment of his conception will live on those terms, and at the same time he will guarantee with a similar strength of mind that no events take him by surprise. For by foreseeing anything that can happen as though it will happen he will soften the onslaught of all his troubles, which present no surprises to those who are ready and waiting for them, but fall heavily on those who are careless in the expectation that all will be well. ‘What can happen to one can happen to all.' ‘What can happen to one can happen to all.’ If you let this idea sink into your vitals, and regard all the ills of other people (of which every day shows an enormous supply) as having a clear path to you too, you will be armed long before you are attacked. Know, then, that every condition can change, and whatever happens to anyone can happen to you too. The next thing to ensure is that we do not waste our energies pointlessly or in pointless activities: that is, not to long either for what we cannot achieve, or for what, once gained, only makes us realize too late and after much exertion the futility of our desires. We should also make ourselves flexible, so that we do not pin our hopes too much on our set plans, and can move over to those things to which chance has brought us, without dreading a change in either our purpose or our condition, We should also make ourselves flexible, so that we do not pin our hopes too much on our set plans, and can move over to those things to which chance has brought us, without dreading a change in either our purpose or our condition, provided that fickleness, that fault most inimical to tranquillity, does not get hold of us. So we should make light of all things and endure them with tolerance: it is more civilized to make fun of life than to bewail it. The mind should not be kept continuously at the same pitch of concentration, but given amusing diversions. We must indulge the mind and from time to time allow it the leisure which is its food and strength. We must go for walks out of doors, so that the mind can be strengthened and invigorated by a clear sky and plenty of fresh air. At times it will acquire fresh energy from a journey by carriage and a change of scene, or from socializing and drinking freely. Occasionally we should even come to the point of intoxication, sinking into drink but not being totally flooded by it; for it does wash away cares, and stirs the mind to its depths, and heals sorrow just as it heals certain diseases."
Ignore Everybody by Hugh MacLeod,"Nobody knows the best way to deliver your unique idea, no matter how smart they seem. Every artist has to find a way to make a living and share their work, preferably in a way that doesn't ruin both. Finding your own voice and sharing that voice with the world is the most important thing.","The more unique your idea is, the harder it will be for people to give you good advice. Ignore everybody. You have to put in the hours. Skill, natural talent, etc. matters less and less as you work more and more hours. In the long run, the people who work hardest, longest win. Your friends love you for who you are right now. Good ideas alter the power balance in relationships because they mean you become something new. You friends may not want to grow with you. This is why good ideas are always initially resisted. Most people are more concerned with what their team members and coworkers think than if an idea is interesting and useful. Why? Because it hurts to be rejected by the people we know, so we seek their approval. For every artist there is always a tension between sex (what you want to do) and cash (what pays the bills). As soon as you accept this your career will move ahead faster. Team players aren't very good at creating value in their own. “I don't know. What do you think?” If you don't see yourself as particularly creative, then that is a self imposed limitation. Only you can decide if you carry that limitation around with you forever. “Everybody has their own private Mount Everest they were put on this earth to climb. You may never reach the summit; for that you will be forgiven. But if you don't make at least one serious attempt to get above the snow line, years later you will find yourself lying on your deathbed, and all you will feel is emptiness.” Most people hide behind pillars. Pillars are fancy equipment, stuff not required to just do the work. Assume that you will receive no recognition for the work you do. Assume that nobody will care. Then, create it anyway. We underestimate how much time, discipline, and stamina play a part in our success. “Meanwhile, the competition is at home, working their asses off.” No one person can be good at everything. All the great artists and entrepreneurs figure out ways to get around their limitations. There is no reason being bad at some aspect of your art should prevent you from sharing the art entirely. “I will love you forever. So long as sex maintains its current level.” “Quality isn't Job One. Being totally fucking amazing is Job One.” “Selling out is harder than it looks. Diluting your product to make it more commercial will just make people like it less.” It's not about the success you receive. It's about what you are going to create with the short amount of time you have left on this planet. “You have to find a way of working that makes it dead easy to take full advantage of your inspired moments. They never hit at a convenient time, nor do they last long.” Writers block is when you have nothing to say, but somehow think you should. Don't be so hard on yourself. Go out into the world, experience life, and write when you have something to say. Every great artist has their own voice. You have to find yours. (Writing plus sketches?) The best way to get approval is to not need it. “People who are ‘ready' give off a different vibe from people who aren't… The minute you become ready is the minute you stop dreaming.” “The less you can live on, the more chance your idea will succeed. This is true even after you've made it.” “Savor obscurity while it lasts. Once you make it your work is never the same.” “Work hard. Keep at it. Live simply and quietly. Remain humble. Stay positive. Create your own luck. Be nice. Be polite.”"
The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt,"Doing work and making money are not the same thing. Simplify your problem to the point where you understand the true goal of your organization. With your goal in mind, identify the constraints within your system (i.e. bottlenecks) and focus on improving the output of that constraint without worrying about the productivity of all related processes.","Scientific ideas can never be proven. They can only be disproven. Scientific theories are not “truth” themselves, they simply explain a lot of natural processes. To learn, we should not just give people results to memorize, but stories and plots that allow us to deduce the answers. “Whenever we think we have final answers, progress, science, and understanding of our world ceases.” Doing work and making money are not the same thing. Not all work leads to making money. Much of it is wasted. “Just about everyone is working all the time, but we're not making any money.” Three metrics that will tell you if the business is doing well: net profit, return on investment, and cash flow. All three should be increasing all the time. You can express a goal in different ways. How can you express “make money” in terms that fit your business model? Three indicators of a healthy business: Operational expense, inventory, and throughput. Three important questions to ask: 1) Did we sell any more products? 2) Did expenses go down? 3) Did inventory go down? Most processes are a series of dependent events. In any series of dependent events most people can only go as fast as the people in front of them. Because of this, your throughput is only the output of the final person / step in the process. Put the fat kid in front. Reverse the order so that the processes go from slow to fast. You have to optimize the whole system, not just a local process. There is always a bottleneck in every process. You have to manage the process based on the bottleneck. The area with the biggest amount of inventory is usually a sign of a bottleneck. Make sure the bottleneck only works on good parts by performing quality control before parts go into the bottleneck. You can't afford to waste time within the bottleneck. Most people are so focused on technical details that they can't see the bigger picture. Don't bother “checking the numbers” instead “check your assumptions. “Making an employee work and profiting from that work are two different things.” Rule 1: The capacity of any non-bottleneck process isdeteimed by something else in the system other than its own capacity. Rule 2: Activating a resource and utilizing are source aren't synonymous. A system with local maximums is not an efficient system. You should not try to maximize the productivity of every moment because it's not an optimally designed system. The goal is not to reduce cost, but to increase throughput. This has huge implications because nearly everyone is focused on reducing costs. The Theory of Constraints: Step one: identify the systems constraints. Step two: decide how to exploit the constraints. Step three: subordinate all other processes to the above decisions. Step four: elevate and improve the systems constraints. Step five: if in a previous step a constraint has broken, return to step one."
Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson,"The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned. Simply punishing the broken only ensures that they remain broken and we do, too. Each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done.","“Capital punishment means them without the capital get the punishment.” The central question behind Stevenson's work is: how and why people are judged unfairly? “[The United States] has the highest rate of incarceration in the world.” One in three black male babies born this century is expected to be incarcerated. We are the only country in the world that sentences children to life imprisonment without parole. “Each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done.” “The opposite of poverty is not wealth; the opposite of poverty is justice.” “The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned.” If a belief is contextual is it a belief worth holding? For example, let’s say you believe that people who commit terrible crimes, say a drunk driver who kills an innocent motorist in an accident, should be immediately condemned to death. What if that “drunk driver” is your son or daughter, your husband or wife? Suddenly, we start to see the complexity of the situation. “They are a good person who made a terrible mistake.” And if you pointed out this inconsistency, I would assume that many people would say, “Well of course that’s how I’m going to feel. It’s my son. What do you expect?” But that’s sort of the point: the only thing that changed in this circumstance is the distance between you and the person committing the crime. When we’re far enough away from the crime that the person becomes anonymous it is so easy to pass judgment. But when we know their name, their face, their history, the joy they have brought to our lives and the lives of others, the jobs they worked, and the movies they laughed at … then it becomes much more complicated. We see the good and the bad. But the good and the bad is always there, even if the person is just an anonymous criminal to us. So how strong in that belief really? Is it worth holding? Or is it better to apply the mercy we would show to mistaken loved ones to everyone else as well? (Related question: Are all beliefs contextual?) Possible error in thinking about racism: do we have a tendency to view things as racial events rather than racial patterns? We see and acknowledge the well-known racial event or period (slavery, The Civil War, The Civil Rights Movement) but we overlook and ignore the fact that racism was largely unchanged and present for the decades between these events (Jim Crow, sharecropping, etc.). We see the event but forget about the prolonged pattern. (Unless you are a member of the oppressed group, of course. In which case you never forget.) “The return of white supremacy and racial subordination came quickly after federal troops left Alabama in the 1870s.” “Black men are eight times more likely to be killed by police than whites.” “In debates about the death penalty, I had started arguing that we would never think it was humane to pay someone to rape people convicted of rape or assault and abuse someone guilty of assault and abuse.” By the mid-1990s DNA evidence revealed many wrongly convicted death row inmates. “In many states, the number of exonerations exceeded the number of executions.” “Simply punishing the broken—walking away from them or hiding them from sight—only ensures that they remain broken and we do, too. There is no wholeness outside of our reciprocal humanity.” “Each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done.” “The death penalty is not about whether people deserve to die for the crimes they commit. The real question of capital punishment in this country is, Do we deserve to kill?”"
The Power of Fifty Bits by Bob Nease,"The human brain is wired for inattention and inertia. As a result, many people already have good intentions, but don’t follow through due to forgetfulness, procrastination, or a general lack of awareness. We can bridge the gap between our intentions and our behavior by using strategies to lock in our future behavior like active choice, pre-commitment, good design, reframing, and simplicity.","The author, Bob Nease, was an engineer and this book was a result of many experiments not only on himself, but also on large populations. Nease studied “decision analysis” at Stanford, which is essentially an engineering approach to economics and rational decision making. “50 bits design” refers to the 10 million bits of information our brains process and that only 50 bits of that information is conscious thought. Lots of decision making happens “under the radar.” Our brains are extremely sensitive to losses, the group, and the present. 50 bits design assumes most people have good intentions and seeks to find strategies to activate those good intentions. “The goal of this audiobook is to help you understand why we do what we do and to equip you with practical tools and a set of principles that you can use to change behavior for the better.” Generally speaking, behavior is the “rate limiter” in our lives. We can usually get information, access, technology, and resources fast enough these days. But doing the right thing with all the resources at our disposal is a much harder task. The human brain is wired for inattention and inertia. The human brain prefers to focus on things that are either painful or pleasurable. The intent-behavior gap: marketers, leaders, and designers often INFER what the user wants based on actual behaviors. In fact, most people aren’t paying close attention and so their actions are rarely an indication of their optimal preferences. Their is a gap between what they truly intend and what they actually do. Because of the intent-behavior gap, we (marketers and business people) focus TONS of energy on persuading people’s intent to buy a given product or act in a given way. Nease argues that this logic is flawed because we are spending lots of time and money trying to market to an intention the user already believes in. They don’t need to be persuaded to believe in the value of education or in the productivity boost of better time management or in the health impact of eating better. They already have those good intentions. Now, they need to act on them. What we need is to activate the good intentions that people already have. We should expect people to forget and procrastinate often. Non-adherence is accidental, not deliberate. It’s just a result of our brain being wired for inattentiveness. This reminds me of what Bryan Harris said about product launches. At any given time, your product is like number 150 on someone’s to-do list. They simply aren’t aware. The goal of a great product launch is to skyrocket your product up into the top 10 of your customer’s to-do list. They can only act once they are aware. We should ask if our behaviors are adaptive or maladaptive to the current environment we find ourselves in. Often, behaviors that are adaptive to our environment seem “rational” (economic terms) and behaviors that are maladaptive to our environment seem “irrational” (psychology terms). Example of priming? One study claimed people named “Dennis” are more likely to become dentists. Asking people why they do what they do (for example, in a customer survey or focus group) can be a misleading way to get behavior or — at best — incomplete. People are only telling you the 50 bits of conscious thoughts that impact what they do. Everything else that impacts their behavior simply isn’t on their mind and won’t be mentioned. We have three shortcuts that our brain uses frequently. Brain Shortcut 1: Fit in. Humans have a strong urge to fit in and work with one another. For example, one reason many people buy green cars like a Toyota Prius is to “fit in” and showcase their personality and beliefs about living green. Additionally, we often keep track of who is doing the work in a group project or who pays for dinner because people want to feel like things are “fair.” We do not like cheaters or people who don’t contribute their fair share. Social contracts are very important to humans. Brain Shortcut 2: Avoid losses. All losses have a reference point and our brains are wired to feel pain if we just miss that reference point. Examples: Wharton study found the professional golfers make more par putts (avoid bogey) than birdie putts (gains) even though both count for one stroke. Students are more likely to retry SAT if they narrowly miss a round number. Baseball players change strategy near end of season if close to batting .300. The key here is that the losses are close to the reference point. Losses that are far away don't cause the same pain and motivation. Winning a silver medal is more painful than bronze because you narrowly missed gold. With proper design, you can utilize this function of loss aversion to motivate good behaviors. Note: loss aversion is another vote for small habits and one percent improvements because it is only narrow misses that prompt the feeling of loss aversion. Brain Shortcut 3: hyperbolic discounting. We give more weight to long-term benefits when they are in the future and more weight to immediate pleasure when we are in the moment. This leads to a cycle of making earnest plans, procrastinating and choosing something outside the plan in the moment, making more earnest plans for the future, and so on. (I believe this is the same idea as time inconsistency.) There are 7 strategies we can use to turn the good intentions we already have into consistent behaviors. Strategy 1: Active choice. This strategy interrupts the user during a process or workflow and asks them to make an active choice about their preferences. For example, PetSmart interrupts the checkout process to ask users if they want to donate to “help save homeless animals.” Through that strategy alone, they raised over $40 million in a year. This is an interesting indication that there was a lot of latent demand to donate for homeless animals. People didn’t need to be convinced, they simply needed to be asked at a moment when they had the power to act. The rest of the time, the issue of donating simply wasn’t on their radar (even though the desire / intention was there). It’s important to note that this strategy asks you to make processes less seamless for the user, but the interruption occurs at an important and well-considered moment. Strategy 2: Lock in good intentions for the future. Use pre-commitment and implementation intentions to secure good behaviors. Remove all of your TVs from your home. Throw out all sweets and candy. Voluntarily add your name to the “do not gamble” list. Take the drug antabuse to make yourself feel sick if you drink alcohol, etc. Richard Thaler ran an experiment on pre-commitment and created an automatic 401k saving program that increased savings as employees earned raises. What they found was that people saved nearly double the amount they would have for retirement. Most people WANTED to save more, they just never got around to it when their pay increased because of inattention and inertia. Thaler’s plan made it automatic. The author ran an implementation intentions study at Express Scripts to increase participation at the annual walk. People who pledged to walk were 3 times more likely to show up vs. those just saying they would walk. When used as prescribed, the pill has a failure rate (i.e. unintended pregnancy) of only 1%. But in the real world, people delay getting prescriptions, forget to take it, etc. and the failure rate jumps to 9%. Meanwhile, implantable contraceptives (known as “long-acting reversible contraceptive methods”) have a failure rate in the real world of less than 1%. That is, they make contraception happen automatically everyday in the future once the decision to use them have been made. This technological fix makes the right behaviors automatic by shifting it to a one-time decision that bypasses our daily inattention and inertia. Behavior-based commitments (e.g. “workout 3 days per week”) work better than outcome-based commitments (e.g. “lose 20 pounds”) because it is too easy to make exceptions in the moment when the outcome is in the future. Meanwhile, the behavior is also in the moment, so sticking to your behavior is a choice for the here and now. Of course, the outcome are often a natural consequence of the behavior as well. Strategy 3: Let it ride. Make the default decision a better one. Rely on people to “opt out” rather than “opt in.” It’s the difference between requiring consent vs. assumed consent. Basically, people procrastinate on everything. In this way, you let people lock themselves into better behaviors. This is also a really compelling example of the fact that people aren’t paying attention. We live our lives with inattention and inertia. Use the opt-out approach only when there will not be a ton of people wanting to opt-out. Strategy 4: Get in the flow. Items that are most frequently bought are at eye level and on the displays at the ends of aisles. You post a sticky note on the mirror to remind yourself in the morning. Amazon adds recommendations beneath the items you are browsing. Netflix does the same with shows. Home delivery prescriptions coming with a message on the final refill that says on top of the cap: “Last refill. Call your doctor. New Rx needed.” These are all examples of injecting reminders into the normal flow of the user. The power of getting in the flow is best when they user can act upon the reminder immediately. In other words, it should be a hot trigger. Strategy 5: Reframe the choices. Consider if Petsmart asked customers to “donate to animal shelters” vs. “donate to save homeless pets.” It’s a small shift, but a big difference. Homeless pets is a very personal, emotional phrase and it leads to more action. Basically, this is just great copywriting. Word choice matters. This is especially big to consider when crafting behavior for businesses and governments. Social norms messaging can shift behavior is a positive way. For example, showing people how they compared on energy consumption to their neighbors led to improvements in energy consumption. You have to be careful using this strategy though. Social norms mean some people are “in the group” and some people are “out of the group.” That “out of the group” segment can often react negatively to social norms messaging, which nullifies the positive impacts. It is best to “bundle losses and enumerate gains.” Amazon Prime is a good example. They bundle all of the losses (shipping fees) into one yearly cost. Then, they enumerate gains by showing you the “free shipping” options every time you purchase. This matches with the philosophy of “stacking the pain” that I learned in business school. Decoy options are another way to change behavior and nudge people toward a particular option. Piggybacking is when you use pleasure in the present moment to pull people into behaviors that are better over the long term. One example was making toothpaste pleasant to use. One way to do this is to change the experience (like the toothpaste example). Another way to do it is with temptation bundling (Katy Milkman’s strategies). When you are presenting multiple options to someone, you should offer them in order of decreasing effectiveness. That is, the most effective option is covered first. Then, the second most effective. And so on. This ensures that the entire conversation is framed around the topic of effectiveness and, thus, the person you are talking to can make a decision for what they want while always knowing what works best. Offering alternatives in a different order often colors the conversation and frames it around something besides effectiveness. For example, the conversation might be framed around the option you are currently using or around the option you are most familiar with already. Write out, in plain language, the behavior you intend to follow. Avoid deception. Ask yourself whether a reasonable person armed would feel deceived by the way you are presenting information or nudging behavior if they knew everything you did. Typically, we use big data to change behavior by targeting specific populations and tailoring recommendations to them. Which segment should receive a coupon? And so on. These choices are often made from a marketing and persuasion standpoint. By realizing that most people fail to act because of forgetfulness and procrastination (not a lack of desire), you can open up new opportunities for using big data. Fifty Bits Design assumes the best in people. There is no trickery or deception. It assumes people want the best and then simply presents them with better options and improves their ability to act on the good intentions they already have."
Resplendent Light by Christopher Burkett,A book of 68 photos by master landscape photographer Christopher Burkett.,"It is interesting to see Burkett improve as a photographer over time. This book has many images from the mid-1980s as well as some from the mid-1990s. In my opinion the more recent images are better. Cool to see the improvement. He is so good at creating images with high contrast between the foreground and background. Plate 22, Plate 33, and Plate 47 are good examples. He is great at using vertical tree trunks and spreading branches to fill the frame. See Plate 28. Many of Burkett's images that stun me at first glance are aspen trees in fall. He does a great job of finding backlighting for the leaves and dark backgrounds, but the white trunks really make the images sing. Burkett is a master of light. He only uses bright light when it enhances the subject. And many of his images in overcast light maintain great dynamic range. See Plate 64."
Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb,"Randomness, chance, and luck influence our lives and our work more than we realize. Because of hindsight bias and survivorship bias, in particular, we tend to forget the many who fail, remember the few who succeed, and then create reasons and patterns for their success even though it was largely random. Mild success can be explainable by skills and hard work, but wild success is usually attributable to variance and luck.","According to Taleb, the book's most popular chapter was Chapter 11, the one in which he compressed all the literature on the topic of miscalculating probability. Important point: “it's more random than we think, not it is all random.” Chance favors preparedness, but it is not caused by preparedness (same for hard work, skills, etc.) “This business of journalism is just about entertainment, particularly when it comes to radio and television.” As much as we want to “keep it simple, stupid” … It is precisely the simplification of issues that are actually very complex, which can be dangerous. “Things that happen with little help from luck are more resistant to randomness.” “Mild success can be explainable by skills and labor. Wild success is attributable to variance.” One common theory for why people pursue leadership is because of “social emotions” which cause others to be influenced by a person due to small, almost imperceptible physical signals like charisma, gestures, and gait. This has also been shown via evolutionary psychology: when you perform well in life, you get all “puffed up” in the way you carry yourself, the bounce in your step, etc. From an evolution standpoint this is great because it becomes easier to spot the most successful / desirable mate. The concept of alternative histories is particularly interesting. If you were to relive a set of events 1000 times, what would the range of outcomes be? If there is very little variance in your alternative histories (i.e. You chose to become a dentist and you will probably make more or less the same amount of money and live a similar lifestyle all 1000 times), then you are in a relatively non- random situation. Meanwhile, if there is a very wide range of normal results when considering 1,000 variations (entrepreneurs, traders, etc.), then it is a very random situation. The quality of a choice cannot be judged just by the result. (I first learned this in baseball. Just because a pitch you call or play you call doesn't work out doesn't make it a poor choice. It could have been the right call, but bad luck. Or vice versa.) “Certainty is something that is likely to take place across the highest number of different alternative histories. Uncertainty concerns events that should take place in the lowest number of them.” You should think carefully about getting more insurance / shielding yourself from events that — although unlikely — could be catastrophic. You essentially want to insulate yourself from terrible random accidents. We have a tendency to see risks against specific things as more likely than general risks (dying in a terrorist attack while traveling vs. dying on your next trip, even though the second includes the first). We seem to overvalue the things that trigger an emotional response and undervalue the things that aren't as emotional. We are so mentally wired to overvalue the sensational stories that you can “realize informational gains by dispensing with the news.” Fascinating famous Swiss study of the amnesia patient who couldn't remember doctor's name but did remember him pricking her hand with a pin. “Every man believes that he is quite different.” It's better to value old, distilled thoughts than “new thinking” because for an idea to last so long it must be good. That is, old ideas have had to stand the test of time. New ideas have not. Some new ideas will end up lasting, but most will not. The ratio of undistilled information to distilled is rising. Let's call information that has never had to prove its truth more than once or twice, undistilled. And information that has been filtered through many years, counter arguments, and situations is distilled. You want more distilled information (concepts that stand the test of time and rigorous analysis) and less undistilled information (the news, reactionary opinions, and “cutting edge” research). There is nothing wrong with losing. The problem is losing more than you plan to lose. You need clear rules that limit your downside. (“If any investment loses one million dollars then our firm sells immediately.”) Much of what is randomness is timing. The best strategy for a given time period is often not the best strategy overall. In any given cycle, certain places will be dangerous, certain trading strategies will be fruitful, etc. If you find yourself doing something extraordinarily well in a random situation, then keep doing what's working but limit your downside. There is nothing wrong with benefitting from randomness so long as you protect yourself from negative random events. Randomness means there are some strategies that work well for any given cycle (an extreme fad diet), but these cycles are often short to medium term successes. More importantly, the strategies that work for a given cycle in the short term may not be the best for long run. They are sub optimal strategies winning over a randomly beneficial short term cycle. The same can said for setting huge goals, following a fad diet, chasing an extreme training protocol, and so on. Unsustainable and suboptimal for the long term. In this way, evolutionary traits that are undesirable can survive for a period of time in any given population. That is, suboptimal strategies and traits can seem desirable in the short run even though they will be resoundingly defeated in the long run. Important point: you can never affirm a statement, merely confirm its rejection. There is a big difference between “this has never happened” and “this will ever happen.” You can say the first, but never truly confirm the second. It just takes one counter example to prove all previous observations wrong. We never know things for sure, only with varying degrees of certainty. There are only two types of ideas. Those that have been proven wrong and those which have yet to be proved wrong. (Feynman said something similar.) Strive to become a man of leisure who can afford to sit with ideas, think properly about them, and gradually provide something of value. Science is speculation. This is important to remember. Scientists are simply creating well-formed and well-educated conjectures about the world. But they are still conjectures that can be proved incorrect by one random event. It's a difficult standard to demand that you can actually implement ideas and not merely share them (there have been many brilliant philosophers and scientists who have had great ideas they didn't personally use), but is an idea really that great if you can stick to it? Obviously, everyone has different skills and circumstances, so maybe someone can use your idea even if you can't. But generally speaking, I think you should be able to live out the ideas you share. Pascal: “the optimal strategy for humans is to believe in the existence of God. For, if God exists, then the believer will be rewarded. If God does not exist, the believer will have nothing to lose.” My first thought: “yes, but what if you believe in the ‘wrong' God?” Should you play a numbers game and believe in the God most people believe in? Or, can we safely assume that of the infinite number of possible Gods humans could have designed it is unlikely that any of the ones we worship are actually the God? So, just believe that a higher power exists? Whew. Tough call here. Social treadmill effect: you get rich, move to a better neighborhood, surround yourself with more successful people, and feel poor again. “Remember that nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his failure.” Skewness and expectations: you can't just look at the odds of something happening, but also the payoff you receive if it works (and the cost of it failing). A bet on something very unlikely can be smart if the payoff is large and you have rules to limit the many small losses that are likely. Minor stalemates in life can often be solved by choosing randomly. In many cases it doesn't really matter so long as you choose something and move forward. We follow rules not because they are the best options, but because they make things fast and easy. Humans are inherently flawed. The cognitive biases that we have are simply a result of how our brains work. Sometimes these biases help us rather than hurt us. But they are always a result of how we are built. That makes them particularly difficult to avoid. We seem to focus too much on “local” changes, not global ones. That is, we care too much about the latest change rather than the overall trend. “Wealth does not make people happy, but positive increases in wealth may.” We do not think, but use heuristics to make decisions. Emotions are “lubricants of reason.” We actually need to feel things to make decisions. Emotions give us energy and they are actually critical to life in the day-to-day world. In other words, the goal here is not to become a robot who can analyze everything with perfect logic. Even if you know about randomness and cognitive biases, you are still just as likely to fall victim to them. How to overcome these biases? We need tricks. We are just animals and we need to re-structure our environment to control our emotions in a smart way. “Most of us know pretty much how we should behave. It is the execution that is the problem, not the absence of knowledge.” “I try to remind my group each week that we are all idiots and know nothing, but we have the good fortune of knowing it.” Do not blame others for your failures. Even if they are at fault. The only aspect of your life that fortune does not have control over is your behavior. Repetitiveness is key for determining if you are seeing skill or randomness at play. Can't repeat it? Not skillful. “We favor the visible, the embedded, the personal, the narrated, and the tangible. We scorn the abstract. Everything good — aesthetics, ethics — and wrong — fooled by randomness — with us seems to flow from it.”"
On the Move: A Life by Oliver Sacks,"Oliver Sacks was a brilliant physician and a fantastic writer. He lived a full life that included dealing with criticism over being gay, attending medical school at Oxford University, experimenting with heavy drug use, traveling the United States and Canada by motorcycle, suffering life threatening injuries, squatting a California state record of 600 pounds, and being honored by the Queen of England for his many books and storied career as a physician. Sacks is a symbol of the importance of writing, the power of exploration and inquisitiveness, and the need for empathy.","Sacks makes a brilliant point when talking about the treatment of his schizophrenic brother: medicine should not merely be about treating symptoms, but also about the meaning and freedom and social well being of the patient. On his tendency to eat a lot whenever food was around: “In the absence of internal controls, I have to have external ones. I have fixed routines for eating.” During his weightlifting days, he favored stiff-legged deadlifts to improve his back strength. Sacks believes that the history and human elements of science are important to our knowledge and understanding. So often researchers and experts will ignore anything older than five years because it is “outdated.” But Sacks loves learning about the inspiring discoveries of old researchers and the history of chemistry or physics or biology. These stories increase his overall sense of understanding and perspective. Sacks once abducted a patient from the neurology ward and took her on a motorcycle ride to honor the final request of her dying life. He probably should have been fired, but wasn't because he was also incredibly valuable to the department. His experience shows the importance of possessing rare and valuable skills. “In general, I was something of an embarrassment to the neurology department, but also something of an ornament: the only resident who had published papers and I think this might have saved my neck on several occasions.” Sacks created such muscular imbalances with his squatting that he tore both quadriceps tendons. Make sure you take proper care to build a strong, but balanced body. Sacks took many drugs during his twenties and during one hallucination he called his friend Carol to say he was about to die. She asked, “What have you just taken?” He responded, “Nothing! That's why I'm so scared.” She paused then asked, “What have you stopped taking?” And they got to the bottom of the problem. I thought Carol's line of questioning was brilliant. She inverted the question, during a tense and emotional moment, and got a totally different answer. Sacks was an incredibly multidisciplinary thinker and physician. I love that. The greatest thinkers see the relatedness between concepts. “It seems to me that I discover my thoughts through the act of writing — in the act of writing.” Sacks calls himself a “physician, teacher and storyteller.” I like those descriptions. Sacks had an incredible book editor who once phoned him in Australia to ask how he felt about replacing a comma with a semicolon. Ludwig Wittgenstein said a book should consist of examples. And Sacks used this method in his books. The examples of the patients in his books really connected with readers. (You should do the same in your own writing.) While working with deaf students Sacks referred to them as “hearing impaired ” and one of the students signed back to say maybe he was “sign impaired.” Like many fantastic writers, Sacks has no throttle on his writing tendency. He often behins with the intention of adding a footnote or penning a few paragraphs and suddenly that small idea expands into the biggest section of the book. I see this over and over with top artists. Once the faucet starts flowing they can't turn it off. Instead, the act of writing unleashes a fire hose of thoughts and inspiration. I think it is a sign they love their work beyond measure. Sacks says that in the 70s and 80s everyone was talking about Skinner's stimulus and response theory, but not many people thought about what came between stimulus and response. That is, the mind and how it processes those stimuli and responses. Sacks would get obsessed with one or two pieces of music and play them again and again. (So do I!) Neural Darwinism, Gerald Edelman's theory of consciousness, is essentially experiential natural selection. In other words, just as natural selection gradually leads the species in a particular direction so do our personal experiments and experiences lead us in a particular direction. We discover what we like, what we don't like, what works for us, how to walk, and so on through a series of experiences and experiments. It's like natural selection, but on an individual scale. It's natural selection in our own brains and lives. Each baby learns how to walk and how to pick things up in their own way. We do not each follow the same motor patterns. Instead, we experiment with various motor patterns and, over the course of weeks and months, select the ones that work best for us. In this way and in many others, we make our own individual paths through life. Hearing about the extensive writing and personal notetaking that Sacks did throughout his life makes me feel even stronger about the importance of writing. We need to observe and record the experiences that happen to us. The things we live through can teach us an incredible amount, but only if we are willing to investigate and learn lessons from them. Keeping a journal and writing about your life is a fantastic way to make sense of the world and leave lessons for others to build upon. “The act of writing is itself enough. It serves to clarify my thoughts and feelings. The act of writing is an integral part of my mental life. Ideas emerge, are shaped, in the act of writing.”"

","The solution is profoundly simple: Take your profit first. Money is the foundation. Without enough money, we cannot take our message, our products, or our services to the world. Without enough money, we are slaves to the businesses we launched. Growth is only half the equation. It is an important half, but still only half. Most business owners try to grow their way out of their problems, hinging salvation on the next big sale or customer or investor, but the result is simply a bigger monster. The perfect size for your business? It will happen naturally, when you take your profit first. Profit is not an event. Profit is not something that happens at year-end or at the end of your five-year plan or someday. Profit isn’t even something that waits until tomorrow. Profit must happen now and always. Profit must be baked into your business. Every day, every transaction, every moment. Profit is not an event. Profit is a habit. Profit must be baked into your business. Every day, every transaction, every moment. Profit is not an event. Profit is a habit. Profit is not an event. “Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, and cash is king”? Take profit first. You can’t grow out of your profit problem. You need to fix profit first, then grow. You must figure out the things that make profit and dump the things that don’t. Sustained profitability depends on efficiency. When less money is available to run your business, you will find ways to get the same or better results with less. By taking your profit first, you will be forced to think smarter and innovate more. We place additional significance on whatever we encounter first. When profit comes first, it is the focus, and it is never forgotten. Eliminating unnecessary expenses will bring more health to your business than you can ever imagine. If you get a $1,000 deposit, I am telling you, starting today, transfer $10 into your PROFIT account. If you could run your business off $1,000, you can surely run it off $990. If you get $20,000 in deposits, you transfer $200 into your PROFIT account. If you can run your business off $20,000 you absolutely can run it off $19,800. You’ll never miss that 1 percent. It is a low bar. But something magical will happen. You will start proving the system to yourself. You won’t get rich overnight this way, but you will get a wealth of confidence. Profit First is a cash-management system. Run your business based on what you can afford to do today, not what you hope to be able to afford someday."
The Reason I Jump by Naoki Higashida,This book is an autobiography written by a 13-year-old boy from Japan about what it is like to live with autism. The way autistic people view the world is very different than the way we may perceive them to view the world. This disconnect between how we view and treat people with autism and how they actually view the world makes living with autism is even more difficult than it already is.,"“When you see an object, it seems that you see it as an entire thing first, and only afterwards do its details follow on. But for people with autism, the details jump straight out at us first of all, and then only gradually, detail by detail, does the whole image float up into focus.” “On our own we simply don't know how to get things done the same way you do things. But, like everyone else, we want to do the best we possibly can. When we sense you've given up on us, it makes us feel miserable. So please keep helping us, through to the end.” “But I ask you, those of you who are with us all day, not to stress yourselves out because of us. When you do this, it feels as if you're denying any value at all that our lives may have–and that saps the spirit we need to soldier on. The hardest ordeal for us is the idea that we are causing grief for other people. We can put up with our own hardships okay, but the thought that our lives are the source of other people's unhappiness, that's plain unbearable.” “True compassion is about not bruising the other person’s self-respect.” “To give the short version, I've learnt that every human being, with or without disabilities, needs to strive to do their best, and by striving for happiness you will arrive at happiness. For us, you see, having autism is normal — so we can't know for sure what your ‘normal' is even like. But so long as we can learn to love ourselves, I'm not sure how much it matters whether we're normal or autistic.” “Everybody has a heart that can be touched by something.” There is a fantastic story that Higashida tells about learning to wave goodbye to a friend. People kept telling him that he was doing it incorrectly, but he didn't understand why until someone had him look in a mirror. He finally realized that he was waving goodbye to  himself  with his palm facing toward his own face rather than his palm facing away and toward the other person. He was simply mimicking what he saw when someone waved goodbye to him (the other person's palm), but couldn't fully translate what he saw into the correct behavior. He spends much of his day feeling like a failure and knows he screws up often. Childish behavior does not equal childish intelligence. My biggest takeaway was that when it comes to many everyday circumstances Higashida “gets it,” but he can't act on it. Perhaps I was just ignorant about autism, but I feel that we often assume that autistic people are “out of it” and aren't really following what's going on. (And how would we know when we have no outward or physical indication otherwise?) But he does understand. He gets context and subtlety. He knows what is happening even if he can't take appropriate action."
The Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clason,Save at least 10 percent of everything you earn and do not confuse your necessary expenses with your desires. Work hard to improve your skills and ensure a future income because wealth is the result of a reliable income stream. You cannot arrive at the fullest measure of success until you crush the spirit of procrastination within you.,"The 7 simple rules of money: 1) Start thy purse to fattening: save money. 2) Control thy expenditures: don't spend more than you need. 3) Make thy gold multiply: invest wisely. 4) Guard thy treasures from loss: avoid investments that sound too good to be true. 5) Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment: own your home. 6) Ensure a future income: protect yourself with life insurance. 7) Improve thy ability to earn: strive to become wiser and more knowledgable. To bring your dreams and desires to fulfillment, you must be successful with money. The laws of money are like the laws of gravity: assured and unchanging. Money is plentiful for those who understand the simple laws of making money. Babylon was the wealthiest city in the world at the time of its height because its people appreciated the value of money. You must constantly have an income that keeps your purse full. “It costs nothing to ask wise advice from a good friend.” It’s simple to say, but many people never achieve a serious measure of wealth because they never seek it. They never truly seek it, focus on it, and commit to it. Youth often assumes, incorrectly, that the old and wise only have wisdom about days gone by. You will only begin building wealth when you start to realize that a part of all the money you earn is yours to keep. That is, pay yourself first. You always pay others for goods and services. Pay yourself as much as you can. Save money. You should save at least 1/10th of what you earn. More if you can afford to do so. Do not take advice on finance from a brick layer. Go to people who are experts in a particular subject if you want expert advice. It’s too easy for amateurs to give out advice. Build for yourself a mountain of gold first, then you can enjoy as many banquets as you wish without worry. Don’t spend your money as soon as you earn it. Surround yourself with people who are familiar with money, who work with it each day, and who make lots of it. Enjoy life while you are here. Do not overstrain to save. Do not put your money in investments which do not pay a dividend, but also do not invest in risky places that seem too good to be true. What each person calls their “necessary expenses” will always grow to match your income unless you resist that urge. Do not confuse your necessary expenses with your desires. “A man’s wealth is not in the coins in his purse. It is in his income.” Ensure a future income. Every person gets old. Make sure your income will continue without work. Buy life insurance. Provide in advance for the protection of your family. Increase your ability to earn. Improve your skills. As you perfect your craft, your ability to earn more increases. The more we know, the more we may earn. The person who seeks to know more of their craft is capable of earning more. You cannot arrive at the fullest measure of success until you crush the spirit of procrastination within you. The 5 Laws of Gold: 1) Gold comes easily and in increasing quantity to the person who saves at least 1/10th of their earnings. 2) Gold labors diligently and multiplies for the person who finds it profitable employment. 3) Gold clings to the protection of the person who invests their gold with wise people. 4) Gold slips away from the person who invests gold into purposes through which they are not familiar. 5) Gold flees the person who tries to force it into impossible earnings. If you desire to help you friend do not do so in a way that brings their burdens onto you. There are many ways to help people. You don’t have to choose the ways that restrict your time, money, energy, or ability to care for yourself. The wise lender always has a guarantee of repayment should the investment go poorly. Above all you should desire safety for your money. Better a little caution than a great regret. Protect yourself with insurance. You cannot afford to be unprotected. Do not live beyond your means. No man respects himself if he does not repay his debts. The soul of a free man looks at the world as a series of problems to be solved. Meanwhile, the soul of a slave whines, “What can I do?” “Where the determination is, a way can be found.” If you are in debt, live on 70% of what you make. Save 10% for yourself. Use the remaining 20% to repay your debts. Stick with the plan. Money accrues surprisingly quickly and debts are gone fast with discipline and consistency. Work attracts friends who admire your industriousness. Work attracts money and opportunity. “Hard work is the best friend I've ever had.”"
Who Moved My Cheese? by Spencer Johnson,"Letting go of what we know is hard, but essential for growth and improvement. The quicker you let go of old things, the sooner you can learn new skills and create a better future. When you change what you believe, you can change what you do.","“What would I do if I wasn't afraid?” “Taking action is key. Moving in a new direction can free you.” Moving past fear is freeing. Quicker you let go of old cheese, the sooner you find new cheese. When you change what you believe, you change what you do. Continue to explore and grow! Even when things are good."
Slipstream Time Hacking by Benjamin Hardy,"What if we measured our lives based on “distance” traveled rather than time elapsed? If we measure life by distance rather than time, then it becomes very clear that you can hack time by figuring out how to jump further along the timeline of life. This enables you to live many lives in one lifetime. For example, someone who retires at age 30 will free up an extra 40+ years of life compared to their peers, which means they can live an entire second life that many people will never get to experience.","The faster someone moves toward a desired destination, the slower time moves for them. But what if we did measure time as a distance? How would our lives look? What if rather than focusing on how long something took, we focused on how far we went? According to Einstein’s special relativity theory, time is a description of distance traveled. This is how time relativity works. Time feels the same to each individual but can be vastly different—speed is relative to each person. What if we were to measure our entire lives as we measure light-speed—as distance traveled rather than time elapsed? How would each day look, if rather than passing through 24 hours, we measured how far we moved that day? “The man who has lived the most is not he who has counted the most years but he who has most felt life.” —Jean-Jacques Rousseau After acclimating to the speed of my new system, it became obvious to me that I had covered more ground in terms of time-distance than many of my associates. In other words, while we had all experienced the same few years, I felt like I had aged, or changed, by decades. Today, innovation is so fast that we accomplish more in a day than previous generations did in a lifetime. If we measure life by distance rather than time, some people may travel great distances on a given day while others can’t remember a single significant thing they did. If time is relative, we don’t need to assume one minute means one minute. Perhaps, five minutes could be squeezed into one minute, of five hours, or five years. The compression of time is not a matter of compounding activities, but the compounding of meaning. If the goals you are pursuing do not require wormholes, your approach to life is far too small. The highest pursuits available are those that literally require exceptions to the rules, because such aims cannot be done conventionally. Nobody achieves the impossible without thinking they can. Once-in-a-lifetime opportunities aren’t really that rare. Those who don’t believe in magic will never find it.” —Roald Dahl The Jewish physicist, Albert Einstein, centered light as the single constancy of the universe with his special relativity theory. Rather than time being the absolute and unchanging force as previous theorists assumed, Einstein rendered light-speed constancy as the unchanging backdrop to his theories. Light is the framework of the universe and the fundamental reality. For example, to a person driving a car, the objects in the car (his iPod or Big Gulp) appear to be motionless despite the fact that they are moving at the speed of the car. The objects are at rest with respect to the driver. The faster an object travels through space, the slower its progress in time. The faster an object travels through space, the slower its progress in time. If an object could travel at the speed of light, time would stand still. To move fast is to have all the time in world. If we have a lot of time, it tends to be filled with busyness. If we are crunched for time, we use that time efficiently. Thus, to slow time, one only needs to set shorter timelines. If the goal is to get to Hawaii in 15 years, reduce that timeline to 15 months and voilà, put on your flower-shirt. If a task is perceived to be unimportant, it will take enormous amounts of time to complete. Conversely, if a task is perceived to be important, it will get done soon—sometimes immediately, depending on how important and urgent. By pursuing things we believe to be important and breaking them down into their smallest parts, time slows and more is accomplished. Certain people are moving so fast that they can arrive at destinations in moments that would take most of us decades. For example, assuming Tim and I had the same goal, if Tim could accomplish this goal in one day (like make a successful multi-million dollar investment) the same would likely take me 10 or more years. Tim is moving over 3,650 times faster than me. Thus, time has dilated 3,650 times for Tim. While he can now set grander and greater goals, I continue plugging along. One day to Tim is 3,650 days to me. Bill Gates is another who is moving so fast he has potentially traveled the same distance in his life as the combined distance of millions of people. Advances in technology are a great example of time dilation. Due to the rapid progress of technology, humanity is able to progress hundreds to thousands of times faster than we used to. From a linear perspective of time, Bill Gates will live the same years as most other people do. From a nonlinear perspective, he is squeezing the same amount of life into seconds that most people experience in their entire lifetime. Each of us has a vision of the ideal life we want to live. Living congruently with our ideal is how time slows down. Consequently, success is defined as living that ideal for the maximum amount of time. The sooner we get there, the longer we have to live. “A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone” —Henry David Thoreau When we were children, time slowed down. Time meant something; or more likely, we were oblivious to linear time. Ignorance of time literally was bliss. In contrast, if we know what we want and align our life to what matters most, to reality, time will slow down. All of those things we have spent our life chasing are nothing more than a distraction from what matters most. The closer we get to reality, our authentic self and desires, the slower time goes. What good is money when you don’t have time? A person choosing to spend large portions of time in an unsatisfying job in order to make ends meet is on a fast track to his deathbed. You may be young in years, but you are closer to death than you think. If a moment is remembered, no matter how quickly it passed, that moment lasts forever. You could live more life in one congruent day than many people live their entire lives. The goal isn’t an infinite quantity of time, but the highest quality of time. This is where time slows down. People who think “I will be happy when…” are speeding up their time rather than slowing it down. In other words, they believe that once they accomplish a certain task or goal, only then will time slow. If we could learn how to get to where we want instantaneously, we could learn the truth that happiness is now. Time can slow now. There is always a way to get to where we want to go almost instantly. Newtonian time’s most fatal flaw is determinism—the present is determined by the past. Don’t let what may appear to be a setback become a missed wormhole of opportunity. Change doesn’t have to take a long time, it happens the instant we decide. Each person lives in their own perceived reality. Stephen Covey expressed, “We don’t see the world as it is, but as we are.” When another cyclist rides directly behind the first, they get caught in this particle trail and experience a large reduction of resistance while simultaneously being pulled forward by the front rider’s momentum diffusion. Riding in the slipstream allows a rider to keep pace while using approximately thirty percent less energy. The root of the word decision means to cut-away and remove other options. Thus, when a decision is made, it is separated from other decisions which could have been made. There are opportunity costs to every decision. When choosing a slipstream to enter, it is crucial to be mindful. Destinations, as well as paths, must be chosen wisely. Don’t get stuck in one slipstream just because it worked in the past. What got you here, won’t get you there. Psychologists have found that the ability to experience joy has a ceiling effect. Whatever we seek—we imagine the satisfaction to be far greater than it really is. Eventually life is just life again. This is the experience of the successful. To them, life is normal. Not worrying about time, money, or volatile relationships is just how life is. The newness has long since worn off. However, even they have moments where they wake up and cannot believe how far they have come. To push my own progress, I chose to surround myself with people several decades (literally) older than me. I made friends with people who were near retirement or already retired. I began to see movies with them, hang out at their houses, and engage in their same activities. I wanted to learn now what took them an entire lifetime of experience to learn. I gradually reduced my time with people my own age, recognizing they were at best, in the same boat I was in, and therefore had less experience and wisdom to offer. When we buy a new home, it isn’t really costing us $300,000. What it really costs is the time spent working to pay the monthly mortgage. Sadly, people today not only spend the time they have, they also spend away their futures. To accrue debt is to sell away our future time. Not only is time the ultimate currency, but in actuality time is our only currency. Our time is the only thing that really belongs to us. Everything else belongs to the world and the universe. We can’t take our money or stuff with us when we die. Although we may “own” something, we don’t really own it. At most, we are stewards over our possessions, but they are ultimately the Earth’s. The only thing that is fundamentally ours is our time. To waste our time is to waste ourselves. There are three distinct requirements for personal freedom: 1) a heart at peace, 2) healthy relationships, and 3) upright character. There are many successful businesses but few successful families. Meaningful moments exist forever in our minds—memories are timeless. We get to relive them again and again. Leadership is not forcing people to follow. Rather than the bee going out searching for honey, it’s being the flower and allowing the bees to come to you. In our world with limitless options, limitless books to read, limitless clothes to wear, limitless paths to take, it is extremely important to be picky. We must not be afraid of committing to our true desires at the expense of forgoing others. I’m not going to be lured by a great opportunity when it’s the wrong opportunity. Those who become the greatest and go the farthest are highly selective about what they take on. They are clear on where they want to go and recognize that most of what life offers will not get them there. Almost everything in life is a non-essential distraction “Most people don’t know why they’re doing what they’re doing. They imitate others, go with the flow, and follow paths without making their own. They spend decades in pursuit of something that someone convinced them they should want, without realizing that it won’t make them happy.” “Anything is possible, but not everything is possible” —Tyler Rex Right now, most of us engage in far too many priorities. If we have more than three priorities, we have none. Everything is a myth. It’s not only impossible, it’s ridiculous. You can’t have it all. The fewer the priorities in our lives the better. “The life of every man is a diary in which he means to write one story, and writes another; and his humblest hour is when he compares the volume as it is with what he vowed to make it.” —J.M. Barrie The gap between what we know we should do and what we actually do is enormous. Despite turbulence and other conditions keeping the plane off course 90% of the flight, most flights arrive in the correct destination at the correct time. The reason for this phenomenon is quite simple—through air traffic control and the inertial guidance system, pilots are constantly correcting. Essentially, the plane is on a straight course and keeps getting nudged a degree off course here and pushed a degree or two off course there. When immediately addressed, these course corrections are not hard to manage. However, if a pilot only occasionally checked the course the aircraft could potentially become so far off course that the requisite corrections would take substantial time and resources to execute. True commitment can only occur when turning back is no longer an option. This moment constitutes conversion in the highest regards. Failure is no longer caused by a lack of commitment. If you are going to fail, you are going to fail epically. If you are going to succeed, you will live at your highest level. “It’s easier to hold to your principles 100 percent of the time than it is to hold to them 98 percent of the time.” —Clayton Christensen When you commit to something 100%, all of your future choices are already made—no matter how attractive the circumstances A true pro gets paid, but doesn’t work for money. A true pro works for love. “To the individual, character is destiny. To the organization, culture is destiny.” —Tony Hsieh Essentialists are people who make fewer decisions, but take the time to contemplate those decisions. By doing so they make fewer, better choices. Avoid checking email or answering the phone during the first few hours of your day—that time is sacred. Checking your email is simply a database of other people’s agendas. Thus, by checking your email at the beginning of the day, you have already set a pattern that your day is not going to be designed by you, but someone else. Leveraging other people’s time, skills, and money is essential for getting where you want to go faster. You simply don’t have the time to do it all. “If you ever find a man who is better than you are – hire him. If necessary, pay him more than you would pay yourself… If you always hire people who are smaller than you, we shall become a company of dwarfs. If, on the other hand, you always hire people who are bigger than you, we shall become a company of giants.” —David Ogilvy Hundreds of thousands of years ago, the world was local and linear. Humans were hunter gatherers, with limited goals, living in limited space. Consequently, our brains have evolved to think locally and linearly. However, today’s world is global and exponential. We all have invisible doors in our direct proximity that will transport us decades into our best futures. The people that have moved the needle of humanity live on forever. The time they have expanded for others is their contribution to humanity—their footprint on evolution. “Do what is right, let the consequence follow.” Life is filled with an almost infinite wealth of hard decisions. You are bound to fumble along time way. One thing is certain, life rewards those who act—the hustlers; not the wishers. When the end of life comes, we leave with nothing but our relationships."
Marcel Duchamp: The Afternoon Interviews by Calvin Tomkins,"This book is a collection of transcriptions from a series of interviews between writer Calvin Tomkins and artist Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp believed strongly in doing work that was free from tradition and starting with as much of a blank slate as possible. He was also quite playful, worked slowly, and saw laziness as a good thing.","This book is a collection of transcriptions from a series of interviews between writer Calvin Tomkins and artist Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp on staying perpetually young: “You must remember, I am ten years older than most of the young people.” “My thinking was changing all the time.” Duchamp believed that art was more than something that appealed to the eye. He thought it should live in the mind and emanate from there more than merely basing art on what looked good. According to Tomkins, the legacy of Duchamp is about freedom from tradition and dogmas of any kind. Duchamp took nothing for granted. He doubted everything and in the process of doubting came up with something new. Duchamp lived extremely simply and on very little money. Duchamp was trying to understand through his work, and sometimes through not working, how to live life in a way that was going to be satisfying. “He wasn't trying to tell you how to live as much as he was trying to figure it out from himself.” “Such an abundant production can only result in mediocrity. There is no time to make very fine work.” “I feel that things of great importance have to be slowly produced.” Interesting insight on art collectors, but probably customers in general: “Collectors tend to feel things. They are feelers, not intellectuals.” In other words, people buy things based on how it makes them feel. Duchamp believed that the monetary influence on art could “melt genius away” and that it ruined the creation of art. In his opinion, the best way to make something great was to completely remove the possibility of making money on it. In other words, go underground and work in private. Interesting take on who determined the value of art: “The artist produces nothing until the onlooker has said, “You have produced something marvelous.” The onlooker has the last word on it.” “If there is no onlooker there is no art, is there? The artist looking at his own art is not enough. He has to have someone look at it. I give to the onlooker more importance than the artist, almost, because not only does he look, but he also gives a judgement.”  On artists being egotistical and already thinking they know everything: “I hate to argue in general. You don't argue with artists, you just say words and they say words, and there is absolutely no connection.” Duchamp makes a distinction between someone as a person and their “essential quality” as a profession. For example, he says many art collectors are nice people, but that the essential wuality of an art collector is to be a parasite on the artist. Duchamp loved playing competitive chess. He enjoyed how clear cut it was. Unlike art, which always had reasoning and conclusions about a particular piece, chess was logical and clear. There was a winner and a loser. Duchamp thought the two opposing interests provided some balance to his life. Duchamp believed slower work resulted in better work. “I produced so little and everything I produced took me quite a long time.” “Everything is becoming mechanized in this life.” Duchamp graduated early and took the fastest route through his required time of military service. He was only an average student, but he believed in getting through the things you were required by society to do as quickly as possible. On seeking praise and reward for your work: “That's another chapter of life, the chapter of ambition. But you have that in business too. You have that everywhere.” “Anything systematized becomes sterile very soon.” “I mean, what's the use of hating? You're just using up your energy and die sooner.” “I remember asking him, “Since you’ve stopped making art, how do you spend your time?” And he said, “Oh, I’m a breather, a respirateur, isn’t that enough?” He asked, “Why do people have to work? Why do people think they have to work?” He talked about how important it was to really breathe, to live life at a different tempo and a different scale from the way most of us live.” On the human tendency to overthink things and our ability to assign meaning to anything: “Words are taken and repeated and after a certain number of repetitions the word takes on an aura of mysticism, of magic. And it goes on because men love to do that.” “You do not know at twenty what you are going to do at forty.” It took Duchamp about one month to finish one of his most famous works, Nude Descending a Staircase No. 2. Duchamp was a very innovative. At one point, after creating a variety of highly regarded works on canvas, he abandoned painting on canvas all together because “canvas and oil paint were the instruments that had been so abused in the last nine centuries.” He abandoned the whole medium in an effort to come up with something completely new, which is how he invented his glass pieces. Duchamp believed art should not follow tradition. “Tradition is the prison in which you live.” “Why should man work to live, after all? The poor thing has been put on earth without his permission to be here. He’s forced to be here… That’s our lot on earth, we have to work to breathe. I don’t see why that’s so admirable. I can conceive of a society where the lazies have a place in the sun. My famous thing was to start a home for the lazies — hospice des paresseux. If you are lazy, and people accept you as doing nothing, you have a right to eat and drink and have shelter and so forth. There would be a home in which you would do all this for nothing. The stipulation would be that you cannot work. If you begin to work you would be sacked immediately.” On his principle that people shouldn’t have to work: “A mother generally gives and never takes from her child except affection. In the family there is more giving than taking. But when you go beyond the concept of the family, you find the need for equivalences. If you give me a flower, I give you a flower. That is an equivalent. Why? If you want to give, you give. If you want to take, you take. But society won’t let you, because society is based on that exchange called money, or barter.” On the differences between art and science: “I don’t know why we should have such reverence for science. It’s a very nice occupation, but nothing more. It has no noblesse to it. It’s just a practical form of activity, to make better Coca-Cola and so forth. It’s always utilitarian. In other words, it hasn’t got the gratuitous attitude that art has, in any case.” “I don’t believe in art. I believe in the artist.”"
The Practicing Mind by Thomas M. Sterner,"All of life is practice in one form or another. Actively practicing something is very different from passively learning. You will never reach a level of performance that feels complete, so learn to love the art of practicing your skill.","The skill is practicing the goal, not having the goal. All of life is practice in one form or another. Good practice is not stressful, it is free flowing. (You get in flow.) Actively practicing something is very different from passively learning. Education: when school funding is determined by how many high test scores we put out, what students actually learn is merely a footnote. Japanese perfect plate story. “Why would I need someone to make sure I do my job correctly?” Your goals are like a rudder on a boat, they provide direction. (Goals as rudder versus a dock?) Judging your work is wasted energy that can't go into the work. If your mind races off, you're like a chariot without the reigns. Take the reigns and be in control of your mind. Your goals are a compass, not the buried treasure. The goal is not the destination or where you end up, but rather the compass that guides the journey. The greatest part of entrepreneurship is breaking down your limiting beliefs. It has nothing to do with money. Zen concept of Beginners Mind. It's harder to concentrate as you advance in skill level. A habit is the “natural way we do something.” There is no point of performance you can achieve where you will feel “done”. Make time to just sit. You need relaxing time."
Stumbling on Happiness by Dan Gilbert,"What makes humans different from every other animal is that we think about the future. However, our brains fall victim to a wide range of biases that cause our predictions of the future (and our memories of the past) to be inaccurate. Because of these mental errors it is remarkably difficult to predict what will make us feel happy.","The greatest ability of the human brain is to imagine, to see the world as it has never been before. “What makes humans different from every other animal is that they think about the future.” Our brain makes predictions incredibly quickly and about nearly everything in life. When our experiences don't match what our brain expects, we feel surprised. The frontal lobe is responsible for planning and anxiety — two key future-oriented functions. Our frontal lobe is what allows us to be the only animal that experiences and envisions the future as we do. We like to daydream because the mere dream itself can be a joy. Within a few weeks even earthquake survivors tend to return to previous levels of optimism. If we don't have the opportunity to predict our future it is more scary than if we can predict s bad future (variable shock study). One of the central needs of humans is to control things. Enacting control over your own life is a source of pleasure. Imagination’s three shortcomings are: 1) Imagination tends to add and remove details, but people do not realize that key details may be fabricated or missing from the imagined scenario. 2) Imagined futures (and pasts) are more like the present than they actually will be (or were). 3) Imagination fails to realize that things will feel different once they actually happen—most notably, the psychological immune system will make bad things feel not so bad as they are imagined to feel. “Experience is unobservable to everyone except the person who it happens to.” “The pursuit of happiness is built into the very definition of desire.” The researcher / tourist study where a construction worker obscures the researcher with a door. We don't notice changes if we are not focused on an experience as it changes. In this case, we rely on our memories to remember and recognize a change, but our memories are quite faulty. Nobody really knows what happiness feels like for others (and there are lots of research-backed reasons why), so that means we can’t say definitely whether someone in a situation that might seem bad to us (like being a conjoined twin) is actually less happy than we are. In fact, it’s entirely possible they are just as happy or even more so. “They only think they’re happy because they don’t know what they are missing.” That’s actually the point. Not knowing what we are missing is the very thing that allows us to be happy despite not having some other opportunity. The Experience-Stretching Hypothesis: your experiential background can dramatically change your happiness levels. Once you know something exists and have experienced pleasure from it, then your definition of happiness changes compared to what it was in the past. Physiological arousal can be interpreted in a variety of ways and our interpretation of the arousal depends on what we believe caused it. But our beliefs can be mistaken and thus we think we’re experiencing one thing when, in fact, we are experiencing something else. We can be wrong about our own experiences. “We might call this the Language Squishing Hypothesis because it suggests that an impoverished experiential background causes language to be squished, as it were, so that the full range of verbal labels actually represents a very restricted range of experiences.” The danger of this theory is that we all have different experiences and that means nobody actually knows what happiness really is. Experience and awareness are closely related but not the same. Experience refers to partaking in an event. Awareness refers to being cognizant that the event is happening. Psychological sciences will always be imperfect because we are trying to observe someone else's subjective experience, but it's the best we've got and the closest an outside observer can get to understanding the inside of someone else's mind. The Law of Large Numbers: when a phenomenon arises from very large numbers of something, but not smaller versions of it. For example, billions of neurons lead to a conscious human brain, but two neurons are not a small version of consciousness. One persons subjective experience of happiness (and life) might be imperfect and subjective, but when we look at hundreds or thousands of people truths and patterns start to emerge. The individual imperfections cancel out. What we think is reality is merely just a version of reality. It's just our interpretation of the world. More in Chapter 3 of audiobook. Our brains “fill in” all sorts of information each day. Our predictions are influenced by our experiences. We make assumptions about things that we predict based on the previous experiences we have had or heard about before. “When we imagine the future we often do so in the blind spot of our minds eye.” It is easy for our mind to notice what is there (a dog barking) but very difficult to notice the absence of something (you rarely recognize a dog not barking as an event because it's just silence). The silences, misses, and absences of events are crucial in determining the real world implications of things, but we rarely pick up on them. We tend to remember what did happen, but not what didn't happen. A life with blindness is about a lot more than being blind, but when we imagine life as a blind person we tend to only think about seeing and forget all the other parts of life. When we imagine the distant future, we tend to imagine things in generalities and gloss over the details. When we imagine things in the near future (like tomorrow), we tend to think in concrete details. It could be useful to perform an exercise where you write down the concrete details of future tasks, events, goals, etc… This will force you to be clear about the specific action steps and fully imagine the details of the event rather than remaining in dream mode where the details are fuzzy or forgotten. Do this each week or month? “One of imaginations shortcomings is that it takes liberties without telling us it has done so.” “When scientists make erroneous predictions they almost always err by predicting that the future will be too much like the present.” Everyone tends to use the present as a way to imagine the future and influence memories of the past. Thus, our memories and imaginations are often closer to our current reality than actual reality. “One of the hallmarks of depression is that when depressed people think future events they can't imagine liking them very much.” Your starting point matters because we often end up close to where we started. (This could be applied to many areas of life: memories, socioeconomic status, education, etc.) Habituation effect decreases pleasure with repeated cycles, but it can fade over time. “Variety is the spice of life” can be false depending on timing. When considering options available to you during a single session (like many appetizers at one meal) variety is good. When considering options spaced out over time (like what to order at your favorite restaurant each month) go with your top pick every time because the habituation effect will decrease between each session and you'll get full enjoyment each time. Presentism refers to judging historical events or people by modern day standards. It is largely useless and unfair because you can't expect historical figures to make the same decisions as we do now because they lived in a very different context. It's “sort of like arresting someone in the 1920s for not wearing a seatbelt.” Most people overestimate how terrible traumatic events will actually be. For example, quadriplegics and earthquake victims generally rate themselves as much happier than people would ever imagine. “We cannot do without reality and we cannot do without illusion. Each serves a purpose, each imposes a limit on the influence of the other, and our experience of the world is the artful compromise that these tough competitors negotiate.” We all look at our version of reality through rose colored lenses, but that version still needs to feel credible. If it's too good, then we will reject it. Research shows that people actually feel less pain when they believe they are suffering for something of great value. We have “psychological immune systems” which often get triggered when we experience particularly traumatic events. These systems protect us from events that we would assume would be intensely painful and thus we are able to recover from them better than we often assume we would. “People are not aware of the fact that their defenses are more likely to be triggered by intense than mild suffering. Thus, they mis-predict their own emotional reactions to misfortunes of different sizes.” “We’re more likely to look for and find a positive view of things we’re stuck with than of things we’re not.” “It’s only when we can’t change our experience that we look for ways to change our view of the experience.” Inescapable situations will trigger our psychological immune systems, which then promote our brain’s ability to deliver a positive outlook and happiness from an inescapable situation. We tend to overvalue freedom. We can easily imagine all of the benefits freedom will provide to us, but we tend to underestimate the fact that freedom hinders us from moving forward because we are constantly debating if their are better options out there. Only when we have fully committed and gone “all in” do we reach an inescapable situation where our brain can easily justify our behavior and circumstances. Simply writing about traumatic events — especially if you explain the event itself — people show increased psychological and physiological well being including increased viral antibodies. Uncertainty can preserve and prolong our happiness. When events seem rare, unexplainable or strange, we tend to value them more than things that can be explained, seem ordinary, or otherwise make general sense. (Note: does this explain something about why we love to believe myths or religious stories, often with very strong emotions?) “The least likely experience is often the most likely memory.” “We tend to remember the best of times and the worst of times not the most likely of times.” There is little evidence supporting the idea that women are more irritable during their menstrual cycle. Wealth will make you much happier when you go from poverty to the middle class but not much more happy beyond that. Some making $5M per year is about as happy as someone making $100K per year. Everyone says that having children is a wonderful and joyous experience. When you actually measure happiness of parents, however, you see that it is not raised at all. We continue to perpetuate that children bring happiness belief because it is a “super replicator.” That is, people who believe kids are great tend to have them (and pass on that belief) and people who believe the opposite tend to avoid having kids. “The average person doesn’t seem herself as average.” One example: 90 percent of motorists consider themselves to be safer than average drivers. Rather than being caused by pure selfishness, this could be an indication of our tendency to believe we are unique and different from others (in good and bad ways). “We don’t always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique.” Bernoulli’s calculation for happiness: multiply the odds of getting what you want by the utility of getting what you want (i.e. probability x pleasure). Each successive dollar provides a little less pleasure than the one before it. “The determination of the value of an item must not be based on its price, but on the utility it yields.” The problem is that it’s nearly impossible to predict the utility we will get from our choices because of the many biases we have. “People are sensitive to relative rather than absolute values.”"
This is Water by David Foster Wallace,Learning “how to think” really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It can be easy to spend our entire lives accepting our natural default ways of thinking rather than choosing to look differently at life. The only thing that is capital-T True is that you get to decide how you’re going to try to see life and how you construct meaning from experience.,"The meaning we construct out of life is a matter of personal, intentional choice. It’s a conscious decision. So often, we hold beliefs so tightly we don’t even realize they can be questioned—arrogance, blind certainty, a closed-mindedness that’s like an imprisonment so complete that the prisoner doesn’t even know he’s locked up. A huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. Our natural setting is to be deeply and literally self-centered. There’s no experience you’ve had that you were not at the absolute center of. We see the whole world through this lens. People who can adjust away from this natural, self-centered setting are often described as “well-adjusted.” It is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive instead of getting hypnotized by the constant monologue inside your head. Learning “how to think” really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. You have to choose what you pay attention to and choose how you construct meaning from experience. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms nearly always shoot themselves in the head. The natural default setting is to think I am at the center of the world and my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world’s priorities. Most days, if you’re aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at life. If you’ve really learned how to think, how to pay attention, then you will know you have other options. The only thing that is capital-T True in life is that you get to decide how you’re going to try to see it. This is the freedom of real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted: You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn’t. Everybody worships. We just get to choose what to worship. The trick is to keep truth up front in daily consciousness. The insidious thing about these forms of worship (money, power, fame, beauty, etc.) is not that they’re evil or sinful; it is that they are unconscious. They are default settings. They’re the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that’s what you’re doing. The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day. That is real freedom. That is being taught how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the “rat race” — the constant, gnawing sense of having had and lost some infinite thing. The biggest of questions is not about life after death. The capital-T Truth is about life before death. It is about making it to thirty, or maybe even fifty, without wanting to shoot yourself in the head. The real value of education has nothing to do with grades or degrees and everything to do with simple awareness—awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, that we have to keep reminding ourselves of it over and over."
Strangers to Ourselves by Timothy Wilson,"We do not realize how much the nonconscious mind impacts our behavior and personality. In many cases, the nonconscious mind influences our behavior more than our conscious thoughts do and the two minds will often conflict with one another, which can make it difficult to keep our desires and our actions in alignment. The first step to bringing our nonconscious inclinations into alignment with our conscious desires is to act more like the person we want to be.","This book answers two main questions: why it is that people often do not know themselves very well. And how they can increase their self-knowledge. Much of what we want to know about ourselves resides outside of conscious awareness. The idea that a large portion of the human mind is nonconscious was Freud's greatest insight. Not only can we study what people are thinking, we can study what goes on inside people's heads that even they can't see. Many of the discoveries by psychological researchers appeared to occur outside of the conscious thoughts of the people they studied. The mind operates most efficiently by relegating a good deal of high-level mental processing to the nonconscious. The adaptive nonconscious mind does an excellent job of sizing up the world, setting goals, initiating action, and warning people of danger. We often refer to the human mind as a single entity. In reality, it is a collection of many processes that work in concert with one another. It is a system of thinking with various mental feedback loops. The mind is a well-designed system that is able to accomplish a great deal in parallel. You can perform a conscious behavior and a nonconscious one at the same time. William Hamilton noted that the human mind can attend to one thing nonconsciously while performing another behavior consciously. Such as drifting to another train of thought while reading aloud. William Hamilton theorized that habits acquired early in life had a distinct effect on nonconscious mental processes. Fascinating: Freud didn't believe experiments and the scientific method could reveal insights about the nonconscious mind. He thought only careful clinical observation could do that. Which might explain how he ended up with so many unscientific theories. It is not possible to access our nonconscious minds, thus one of the best strategies we have is to work backwards by running experiments, examining our behavior, and coming up with a theory that, while unlikely to be perfectly accurate, is useful enough to shed insight on our nonconscious behavior and help adjust our future actions. We could not have a conscious mind without a nonconscious one. We need all of the nonconscious processes (like proprioception) to function properly. Just like a computer screen needs the hardware and software for any image to appear. We often mistakenly equate nonconsciousness with inattention. The nonconscious is composed of mental processes that are inaccessible to consciousness but that influence judgments, feelings, or behavior. Your brain processes 11 million bits of information per second via the five senses. This was calculated by counting the number of receptors on each sense organ and nerve signals being sent to the brain. Your eyes alone process 10 million pieces of information per second. Yet, you can only consciously process 40 of them (and that's a high-end estimate). The vast majority of life lives in the nonconscious mind. The typical explanation for why our nonconscious mind developed is an evolutionary one. Those mental processes were selected for by evolutionary pressures. It's just a theory, but a good theory. The world is “one great blooming, buzzing confusion.” -William James Cocktail Party Effect: tons of people are talking, but you tune them out and focus on your conversation. Then, someone nearby mentions your name in conversation and you suddenly pick up what they are talking about. Were you listening the whole time? You must have been because you heard your name, but you felt fully engaged in the first conversation. Your brain is pulling in tons of information, but only consciously thinking about some of it. This is selective attention. The adaptive nonconscious helps our brains deal with situations where there is a lot to analyze but only a small slice of information that matters. It allows your brain to act like a spotlight and highlight what is happening on center stage while keeping the rest of the theater in the dark. Accessibility of information actually has a neurological component. Information can be “energized” and has higher action potentials when it is easier to recall. When it comes to maintaining a sense of well-being, we are ultimate spin doctors of information. We will twist, confuse, contort, and ignore whatever information we need to maintain our sense of self. Daniel Gilbert refers to this as the psychological immune system, which fires up whenever we are trying to protect our psychological well-being. What makes us feel good depends on our cultures, our personalities, and our level of self-esteem. But our desire to feel good is probably universal. Psychological defenses operate frequently in the nonconscious because that way we don't even realize distortion is occurring (if you realized, you could correct for it). The conflict between the desire to be accurate and the need to feel good about ourselves is one of the major battlegrounds of the self. Nonconscious processes, though generally beneficial, are not perfect. Evolutionary pressures influence our mind as well as our bodies. It is reasonable to assume the adaptive nonconscious is an older system from an evolutionary perspective. Conscious thought evolved later in human history. Idea: I’m not so sure we need to make a hard division between the conscious and nonconscious mind. It might help us understand and discuss the two systems, but in reality, they are both part of the same body. Humans are constantly taking in information. Some of it is known to us and some of it is unknown. Idea: the body is just a collection of many systems or feedback loops and the vast majority of the systems are nonconscious (digestive system, for example). There is at least one conscious system, which is our conscious mind. The adaptive nonconscious cannot think about the past or make plans for the future. It lives in the here and now. The ability to think about and plan for the future endows human with a tremendous survival advantage, but can be a two-edged sword if our conscious decisions conflict with our nonconscious desires. Automatic thinking has five defining features: nonconscious, fast, unintentional, uncontrollable, and effortless. Study by Lepper, Greene, and Nisbett found that children (around the age of 3) who were rewarded for drawing were less likely to draw during free time. Presumably, they applied the discounting principle without knowing it. (“I drew with the pens and was rewarded, thus I must have been drawing because I was rewarded and not because I actually like drawing.”) This discounting principle holds up in adulthood as well where we often find that people actually are less likely to follow through on behaviors they previously enjoyed if they start receiving external rewards for them. Very young children may have a nonconscious mind that drives their behaviors earlier in life than their conscious mind. The adaptive nonconscious learns patterns easily. It is designed to scan our environment and detect patterns. Evolution works with what it has. “Personality is the psychological processes that determine a person's characteristic behavior and thought.” -Gordon Allport Research has revealed five key traits that are fundamental to all people: extroversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. These traits are viewed as the fundamental building blocks of personality that everyone possesses to some degree. Typically, genetic factors have been found to account for 20-50 percent of the variance in these personality traits. In the late 1960s, Walter Mischel noticed that the many ways of analyzing personality only predicted behavior to a modest degree at best. Meanwhile, the social situation provides much stronger clues. The central thesis of this book is that human personality resides in two places: the adaptive nonconscious mind and in conscious construals of ourselves. “Human beings owe a surprisingly large proportion of their cognitive and behavioral capacities to the existence of an automatic self, of which they have no conscious knowledge and over which they have little voluntary control.” -Jonathan Miller Many personality studies predict behavior only slightly better than chance. Three desires seem to be part of the nonconscious personality: the need for affiliation, power, or achievement. When people are describing their own personalities, they are often reporting their theories and constructions, which may or may not correspond to their nonconscious dispositions and motives. It is clear that genetics, culture, and experience all play a role in the formation of the conscious and nonconscious mind. Behavior automaticity (forming habits) is one example of how a behavior can go from conscious to nonconscious and we can't say precisely how. One way something can become automatic (nonconscious) is through lots of repetition and practice. McClellan's research: the kinds of early childhood experiences that affect the nonconscious seem to have a cultural basis. It makes little sense to talk about humans having one “self” when the conscious self and the nonconscious self have stable ways of responding to situations (which often differ significantly). People are motivated to see themselves through rose-colored glasses. Most of us believe we are a little more kind and smart and generous than we actually are. Research by Joachim Brunstein and Oliver Schultheiss has shown the importance of having conscious and nonconscious motives in sync. People who had more alignment between their conscious and nonconscious goals had greater well-being and satisfaction than those who did not. The distinction between personality and the social environment is artificial because people’s personality often determines how they construe their environment. Many social situations tend to be so powerful that virtually everyone construes them in the same way and they overpower personality differences. There may not be any situations in life where the nonconscious mind does not impact our behavior. If that is true, however, it is very hard to know it because our nonconscious mind is inaccessible to us directly. The idea that conscious thoughts cause behavior is vastly overrated. Instead, it is often the case that nonconscious stimuli cause both you actions and the conscious thoughts you use to justify them. Our reasons for why we do the things we do are really just conjectures. That's a hard idea to accept. We want to believe we understand ourselves and our motives better than a stranger would, but that doesn't always appear to be the case. The idea that we can have nonconscious feelings and emotions is controversial. Many philosophers and scientists reject the idea of nonconscious feelings as an oxymoron. William James believed that emotions are created by experiences and bodily reactions. It is the experience that triggers the emotion. There are different levels of processing within the brain. Wilson refers to them as the low road and high road. Kahneman calls them System 1 and System 2. The point is the same: we have a collection of processes that respond quickly and automatically. And we have a collection of processes that respond slowly, thoughtfully, and often adjust the reactions of the fast processing level. When people are unsure of how they feel, they often understand their emotions based on their bodily responses in that moment (think: love on the bridge study). When it comes to happiness and sadness, only recent events matter. This is especially true for adolescents who can return to their baseline mood within 45 minutes after a spike of extreme happiness or extreme sadness. People are more resilient than they realize. There is some evidence that happiness is a heritable trait. Monozygotic twins have similar levels of happiness even when raised in separate families. It is very important to have something to work toward. The pursuit of a goal is often better than the accomplishment of it. Daily absorption in your work is more important than your paycheck. A change in standards often occurs for people as they experience more of life, but happiness rarely does. What was once special is now the norm. How we judge an experience depends on three factors. First, how we group experiences for comparison (all restaurants vs. Greek restaurants). Second, how recently we experienced something (eating an incredible restaurant last week vs. last year). Third, how much we have experienced something (100 Greek restaurants vs. two). Allostasis vs. homeostasis. In homeostasis, there is a single set point the body tries to maintain. In allostasis, there are upper and lower boundaries at the extremes, but the set point adjusts based on the needs of the situation. It can be useful to think of happiness by using blood pressure as a metaphor. Sometimes blood pressure is maintained at a lower level (like when you sleep) and other times it is maintained at a higher level (like when you are walking around). There is no on perfect blood pressure because the best level depends on what is required for the situation. However, it is advantageous for blood pressure to never get too low or too high. Happiness is similar. We can experience waves and troughs of happiness and sadness, but it’s best to not stay at this level for days or weeks. There are mechanisms in place that prevent you from experiencing prolonged periods of extreme happiness and extreme sadness, and the psychological costs that would accompany prolonged emotional reactions. It is probably not good for us (from the perspective of evolutionary survival) to stay in a state of prolonged happiness or sadness. Opponent Process Theory helps explains what happens at a physiological level when processes oppose one another. Perhaps psychological processes follow similar patterns? Interesting: we seek to make sense of and explain extreme negative and positive events in our lives, but in the process of doing so we reduce the novelty, surprise, and emotional power of the event. Gradually the extraordinary becomes ordinary and loses its emotional impact. Some researchers have theorized there is a psychological immune system responsible for emotional health the same way there is a biological immune system responsible for physical health. Durability bias: we don't realize just how resilient we are. People have a far greater ability to bounce back than they assume. “There is no tragedy so heartbreaking as introspection.” Pennebaker's approach for dealing with traumatic events: write by yourself for 15 minutes per day for three days. Develop a meaningful narrative that helps explain the event. Ruminating over negative events in a repetitive way is not healthy and beneficial. However, thinking through your issues and constructing a meaningful and coherent narrative about these events is an effective way to deal with issues. Even if the narrative is not 100 percent accurate it can have a beneficial effect. Subliminal messages have little to no effect on consumer behavior when used in advertising. There is little harm in believing we are better, more popular, and more talented than we actually are. This likely leads to more happiness and satisfaction. The problems occur when our self estimates deviate too wildly from reality. If we want to change our adaptive nonconscious one method is to start deliberately acting like the person we wish to be. Observations of our own behavior can be a major window into ourselves and why we act the way we do. The problem is we often infer the wrong reasons for our behavior. Namely, we drastically underestimate the power of the situation. Our tendency to underestimate the influence of the situation is known as fundamental attribution error. In many cases, we actually want our nonconscious tendencies to change and align with our conscious motives and desires. “We acquire virtues by first having put them into action. We become just by the practice of just actions, self-control by exercising self-control, and courageous by performing acts of courage.” -Aristotle The first step to changing our nonconscious inclinations is to change our behavior. Act your way into a new way of being. There are two ways our actions lead to change at the automatic, nonconscious level. The first is by providing the opportunity for our brains to infer from our behavior (nonconsciously) that we are new people. It gives your mind new data and more bits of insight about your attitudes and feelings. (Note: this is similar to your identity votes concept.) Second, the more frequently we perform a behavior, the more automatic it becomes. One of the most enduring lessons of social psychology is that behavior change often precedes changes in attitudes and feelings. Changing our behavior to match our desired conscious perceptions of ourselves is a good way to bring about changes in the adaptive nonconscious. A simple approach to becoming better: do good, be good. By acting in ways that are helpful and caring toward others, we will view ourselves as more helpful and caring. There is a practice effect associated with acting like the person you want to be. The more you practice it, the better you become. Small changes in behavior can lead to small changes in your self-concept. And small changes in self-concept can make the next change easier. Do the behavior first and let the feelings follow. To establish a desirable pattern of nonconscious motives, the best advice is to practice, practice, practice. Train yourself into the nonconscious mind you want. There is no direct pipeline to the adaptive nonconscious. It must be inferred by taking a careful look at cues from your own behavior and others reactions. What matters most when it comes to making sense of our lives and is that people commit to a believable narrative that corresponds reasonably well to their adaptive nonconscious. You can’t keep revising your story and the reasons for why things happened without ruminating senselessly. A good self narrative does not need to be constantly retold. All of us have the ability to act more like the person we want to be."
The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson,"Finding something important and meaningful in your life is the most productive use of your time and energy. This is true because every life has problems associated with it and finding meaning in your life will help you sustain the effort needed to overcome the particular problems you face. Thus, we can say that the key to living a good life is not giving a fuck about more things, but rather, giving a fuck only about the things that align with your personal values.","Conventional self-help advice which tells you to visualize success and think about the type of person you want to be only reinforces the idea that you are not that thing. Everyone wants you to believe that the secret to a good life is to have a nicer job or a better car or a prettier girlfriend. The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important. We are no longer facing a material crisis. We have plenty of resources: TVs and clothes and goods that we don’t need. The problem we face is existential and spiritual. We have so much stuff and so many opportunities that we don’t know what to give a fuck about anymore. Because there’s an infinite amount of things we can now see or know, there are also an infinite number of ways we can discover that we don’t measure up, that we’re not good enough, that things aren’t as great as they could be. The desire for a more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience. Pursuing something only reinforces that you lack it in the first place. Accepting your experience of life as being great and wonderful is the single greatest thing you can do for your happiness. “You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.” -Albert Camus Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. If you are able to not give a fuck about the pain your goals require, then you become unstoppable. The moments when we don’t give a fuck and take action are often the moments that most define the course of our lives. You are going to die someday. Everyone you know is going to die soon. And in your short life you only have a certain amount of fucks to give. Learning how to focus and prioritize your thoughts effectively based on finely honed personal values is perhaps the greatest and most important struggle in life. Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck is not about being indifferent. It just means you’re comfortable with being different. Don’t say fuck it to everything in life, just to the unimportant things. Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first care about something more important than adversity. Subtlety #3: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about. The key is to gradually prune the things you care about, so that you only give a fuck on the most important of occasions. When a person has no problems, the mind automatically finds a way to invent some. I think what most people — especially educated, pampered middle-class white people — consider “life problems” are really just side effects of not having anything more important to worry about. Finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy. It’s okay for things to suck some of the time. Practical enlightenment is the act of becoming comfortable with the idea that some suffering is always inevitable. There is no value in suffering when it is done without purpose. Don't hope for a life without problems. Hope for a life with good problems. Problems never stop. They merely get exchanged or upgraded. Happiness is found in solving problems, not avoiding them. True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving. Happiness is wanting the problems you have and wanting to solve them. Emotions are simply biological signals designed to nudge you in the direction of beneficial change. Negative emotions are a sign that something is going unaddressed. They are a call to action. Positive emotions are the reward for taking the correct action. We should question our emotions because they are not always right. Don’t ask yourself what you want out of life. It’s easy to want success and fame and happiness and great sex. Everybody wants those things. A much more interesting question to ask yourself is, “What kind of pain do I want?” What you are willing to struggle for is a greater determinant of how our lives turn out. You can’t merely be in love with the result. Everybody loves the result. You have to love the process. The climb to the top is a never-ending upward spiral with new problems always surfacing and new processes that you must fall in love with. You are never allowed to stop climbing because the entire point is to love the climb. If you ever stop loving the climb, the results will never come. Self-esteem, by itself, is overrated. It doesn’t help to feel good about yourself unless you have a good reason for feeling that way. The struggle makes self-esteem useful, not the participation trophy. Your problems are not privileged in their severity or pain. You are not unique in your suffering. The more exposed we are to opposing viewpoints, the more we seem to get upset that those other viewpoints exist. This seems like a logical trend to me because before the internet and our hyper-connected modern world, people didn’t have as much likelihood of running into ideas that disagreed with their own. Today, alternate ideas are far more likely to cross your radar screen. Most of us are pretty average at most things we do. Even if you’re exceptional at one thing, chances are you’re average or below average at most other things. Our lives today are filled with information from the extremes of the bell curve of human experience. The best of the best, worst of the worst, and most upsetting of the upsetting. We only see the most exceptional news stories because that’s what drives revenue. This is a real problem when it comes to comparison because you can only be exceptional in one thing thing and you’re going to be below average in nearly everything else. That makes comparison a very dangerous game to play. The problem is that the pervasiveness of technology and mass marketing is screwing up a lot of people’s expectations for themselves. One of the most pervasive narratives about masculinity in our culture is that the most valuable thing a man can attain is sex and it’s worth sacrificing nearly anything to get it. (Interestingly, this corresponds to one of the dominant female narratives, which is that the greatest thing a woman can be is beautiful.) People who are exceptional become that way by thinking they are average and focusing on improvement. You don’t become exceptional by believing you are exceptional. The more uncomfortable the answer, the more likely it is to be true. Problems are inevitable, but what they mean is flexible. We get to control what our problems mean to us based on how we choose to think about them and how we choose to measure them. The way we measure success influences how we view the problems we face. “Pleasure is a false god. Research shows that people who focus their energy on superficial pleasures end up more anxious, more emotionally unstable, and more depressed. Pleasure is the most superficial form of life satisfaction and therefore the easiest to obtain and the easiest to lose.” People who base their self-worth on being right about everything prevent themselves from learning from their mistakes. “One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.” -Sigmund Freud People who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the negative things they think about themselves being reflected back at them. When we feel that we’re choosing our problems, we feel empowered. When we feel that our problems are being forced upon us against our will, we feel victimized and miserable. We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Accepting responsibility for our problems is the first step to solving them. A lot of people hesitate to take responsibility for their problems because they believe that to be responsible for your problems is also to be at fault for your problems. This is not true. We are responsible for experiences that aren’t our fault all the time. This is part of life. People will often fight over who gets to be responsible for successful and happiness. But taking responsibility for our problems is far more important because that’s where real learning comes from. Growth is an endlessly iterative process. When we learn something new, we don’t go from “wrong” to “right.” Rather, we go from wrong to slightly less wrong. We shouldn’t seek to find the ultimate “right” answer for ourselves, but rather, we should seek to chip away at the ways that we’re wrong today so that we can be a little less wrong tomorrow. Certainty is the enemy of growth. All beliefs are wrong—some are just less wrong than others. Counterintuitive insight by Baumeister regarding evil: some of the worst criminals often felt good about themselves. Low self-esteem was not always associated with evil acts. The more you try to become certain about a particular issue, the more uncertain and insecure you will feel. The more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don’t know. The man who believes he knows everything learns nothing. Manson’s Law of Avoidance: The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it. The more something threatens how you view yourself, the more you will avoid getting around to doing it. If I believe I’m a nice guy, I’ll avoid situations that could potentially contradict that belief. If I believe I’m an awesome cook, I’ll seek out opportunities to prove that to myself over and over again. The belief always takes precedence. Manson’s idea of “kill yourself” is similar to Paul Graham’s idea of “keep your identity small.” The central point is that if you don’t have an identity to protect, then change becomes much easier. For any change to happen in your life, you must accept that you were wrong about something you were doing before. “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” -Aristotle If it feels like it’s you versus the world, chances are it’s really just you versus yourself. The magnitude of your success is tied to how many times you’ve failed at that thing. Goals are limited in the amount of happiness they can provide in our lives because they are finite. Once you achieve the goal, it can no longer provide happiness because the finish line has been crossed. Paradoxically, then, by choosing processes as your focus, you can increase your overall, lifelong happiness by focusing on the process and not the goal. Processes never end, which means happiness can continue indefinitely. Action isn’t just the effect of motivation; it’s also the cause of it. Do something and inspiration will follow. How do you write a tons of books? Write “200 crappy words per day” and you’ll find motivation often flows out of you. Manson’s “do something” principle sounds a lot like the philosophy behind the 2-minute rule. Do something now, even if it’s really small, and let good actions cascade as a result. To truly appreciate something, you must confine yourself to it. There’s a certain level of joy and meaning that you reach in life only when you’ve spent decades investing in a single relationship, a single craft, a single career. And you cannot achieve those decades of investment without rejecting the alternatives. The mark of an unhealthy relationship is when two people try to solve each other’s problems in order to feel good about themselves. Trust is the most important ingredient in any relationship for the simple reason that without trust the relationship doesn’t actually mean anything. Investing deeply in one person, one place, one job, one activity might deny us the breadth of experience we’d like, but pursuing a breadth of experience denies us the opportunity to enjoy the rewards of depth of experience. Commitment, in its own way, offers a wealth of opportunity and experiences that would never otherwise be available to you, no matter how many surface level experiences you pursued. Rejection of alternatives liberates us. In a strange way, commitment to one thing offers more freedom than anything else because it relieves you of all the second guessing about what else is out there. If there is no reason to do anything, if life is pointless, then there is also no reason to not do anything. What do you have to lose? You’re going to die anyway, so your fears and embarrassments and failures don’t mean anything. You might as well try. All of the meaning in our life is shaped by our innate desire to never truly die. Our physical bodies will die, but we cling to the idea that we can live on through religion, politics, sports, art, and technological innovation. The only way to be comfortable with death is to understand and see yourself as something bigger than yourself, to contribute to some much larger entity. It is the act of choosing your values and living by them that makes you great, not any outcome or accomplishment. “We’re all going to die, all of us. What a circus! That alone should make us love each other, but it doesn’t.” -Charles Bukowski"
Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari,"Human history has been shaped by three major revolutions: the Cognitive Revolution (70,000 years ago), the Agricultural Revolution (10,000 years ago), and the Scientific Revolution (500 years ago). These revolutions have empowered humans to do something no other form of life has done, which is to create and connect around ideas that do not physically exist (think religion, capitalism, and politics). These shared “myths” have enabled humans to take over the globe and have put humankind on the verge of overcoming the forces of natural selection.","Human cultures began to take shape about 70,000 years ago. There have been three major revolutions in human history: the cognitive revolution, the agricultural revolution, and the scientific revolution. Prehistoric humans (2 million years old or so) were no more important and impressive than other mammals. Homo Sapiens means “wise man.” Humans first evolved in Africa about 2.5 million years ago. The author believes it is unlikely Homo sapiens will survive for another 1,000 years. From about 2 million years ago until 10,000 years ago, multiple human species roamed the earth together. The depiction of man evolving from hunched over to upright incorrectly displays human evolution as a linear trajectory. In fact, the species lived simultaneously. Humans have huge brains for their body size. Human brains account for 2-3 percent of body size, but use 25 percent of energy. Human kind was very much in the middle of the food chain until 400,000 years ago and didn't leap to the top of the food chain until 100,000 years ago. Most animals at the top of the food chain made it there gradually over millions of years. Humans, however, jumped to the top relatively rapidly. This means that the rest of the food chain wasn't ready and neither were we. Hence we feel anxious and stressed because we aren't used to being at the top. The advent of fire and cooking food may have opened the way for the evolution of a smaller intestinal track and a larger brain. There are two theories of how Homo sapiens evolved: Interbreeding theory and Replacement theory. The reality is probably a combination of both theories. Perhaps this is why Homo sapiens wiped out the Neanderthals: “They were too familiar to ignore, but too different to tolerate.” The last dwarf species of humans died out 12,000 years ago. Homo sapiens conquered the world because of its unique language. The Cognitive Revolution occurred between 70,000 to 30,000 years ago. It allowed Homo sapiens to communicate at a level never seen before in language. As far as we know, only Homo sapiens can talk about things we have never seen, touched, or smelled. Think religions, myths, legends, and fantasies. The telling of myths and stories allow Homo sapiens to collaborate in large numbers in extremely flexible ways. This separates us from all other animals. Chimps can't form groups of more than 50 or so. For humans, the group size is usually 150 or so. Beyond that, you can't rely on gossip and personal communication. You need something more to get large numbers of people working together. Large numbers of people can collaborate by sharing common myths and beliefs. In academic circles, stories are known as fictions, social constructs, or imagined realities. An imagined reality is not a lie because the entire group believes it. Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, humans have been living in a dual reality: the physical reality and the imagined reality. The way people cooperate can be changed by changing the stories as myths we tell. Because Homo sapiens shared myths were not genetically based, they could adapt and change their behavior as soon as they adapted their new belief. They didn't have to wait millions of years for a genetic change. Homo sapiens are the only animals that conduct trade. As far as we know, the humans of 30,000 years ago had the same physical, emotional, and intellectual capabilities that we have today. Evolutionary psychology claims that most of our psychology was developed during the period before the Agricultural Revolution about 10,000 years ago. The instinct to gorge on high calorie food is wired into our DNA. Ever since the Agricultural Revolution, there hasn't been one predominant way of life for all humans. There have only been options from a variety of cultures. The dog was the first animal domesticated by humans around 15,000 years ago. In ancient human groups (over 10,000 years ago) there was very little privacy, but also very little loneliness. Most of our ancient ancestors had much wider and deeper knowledge of their physical surroundings than we do. They were not unintelligent at all. The human collective today knows far more overall than the whole population of 15,000 years ago. However, at the individual level we are much more specialized today. Ancient foragers were the most knowledgable and skillful people in history. It is far easier to pass “unremarkable” genes along today than it was 10,000 years ago. Our lack of knowledge about prehistoric religions and beliefs is one of the biggest holes in our understanding of human history. Humans traveling across the sea and landing in Australia was one of the most important expeditions in history. It marked the moment humans cemented themselves at the top of the food chain. Homo sapiens first made it to America about 16,000 years ago. The settling of America – across the Siberian peninsula through Alaska into Canada and the United States down through Mexico and Central America into the Andes and the Amazon and all the way to the tip of South America – was one of the most rapid and incredible invasions by a single species the world had ever seen. Incredibly, the Agricultural Revolution sprang up independently in many different parts of the world. There is no evidence modern humans have become more intelligent with time. The Agricultural Revolution actually didn't make the life of the average human better at first. It did, however, allow humans to collect more food per unit area and thus the overall population multiplied exponentially. Fascinatingly, the first few thousand years of the Agricultural Revolution actually made life harder for humans by creating more work, less leisure, and a ballooning population that created more mouths to feed. Each individual generation didn't see how their life was becoming worse because the small changes were so tiny. One of history's few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people begin to enjoy new luxuries they tend to become expected and then count on them. The evolutionary success of the Agricultural Revolution (greater population) was actually cause for much suffering on the individual level. Not just for humans, but for domesticated animals like cows, sheep, and chickens as well. The advent of the Agricultural Revolution marked the time when worries of the future became prevalent: the weather, the crop yield this year, etc. The myths that surround us and make up our lives dictate so much of what we believe and what we do. Like the ancient Egyptians, most people dedicate their lives to building pyramids. It's just that the names, shapes, and sizes of the pyramids change from one culture to another. In order to change the imagined order, you must first find a group that believes in a current imagined order. New myths must build upon or evolve from previous myths. The main purpose of writing is to record numbers, which our brains did not evolve to manage well. Our brains are much better at remembering biological, zoological, and social information. There is an ancient writing system used by the Incas known as a quipu. They are not written words at all, but a series of knots of different colors and strings that represent words and numbers. Writing has actually changed the way humans think. We can use writing and record keeping to think far more categorically than ever before. Numbers are the world's most prevalent language. Social hierarchies, inequality, and so on are human inventions. Most rich people are rich because they were born into rich families. Most poor people are poor because they were born into poor families. Unjust discrimination often gets worse, not better, with time. As of 2006, there were still 53 countries where a husband could not be legally prosecuted for raping his wife. When it comes to gender inequality: biology enables, culture forbids. The idea of “unnatural” behaviors is actually a result of Christian theology, not biology. If it is possible biologically, then it is natural. From a scientific perspective, two men having sex is natural. Traveling at the speed of light is not natural. Why are men valued in many cultures more than women? All human cultures are filled with inconsistencies. For example, America currently values individual freedom and equality. But these two ideals don't always play nicely. It is part of the human experience to reconcile them. These inconsistencies aren't necessarily bad. They force us to think critically. Consistency is the playground of dull minds. History is moving relentlessly toward unity. The whole planet is moving toward one world culture. The creation of money was purely an intellectual revolution. It doesn't exist except in our minds. More than 90 percent of all money is just electronic data, not physical money. Everyone always wants money precisely because everyone else always wants money. Empires have been the world's most common form of political organization for the last 2,500 years. In general, empires do not fall because of uprisings. They almost always succumb to outside invasion or splits from within the empower class. Most of what we firmly believe is part of “our culture” was actually forced upon us by other empires who conquered our ancestors. Despite the obvious negatives of empires taking over a culture, there are many benefits too. Art, music, governance, and more are the result of empires forming. Often, they blended new together with the conquered people to create a new culture. It seems obvious that we are moving fast toward a singe global empire. Global markets, global warming, and commonly accepted concepts like human rights make it clear we all need one collective entity, not man states and countries. Religion is the third great unifier of humankind, alongside money and empires. The Agricultural Revolution was accompanied by a Religious Revolution. Interestingly, polytheism is more open and accepting of multiple beliefs even though we often look at it as more barbarian and uneducated than our current beliefs. Monotheism seems to push away polytheism, but actually is very similar to polytheistic gods with the use of patron saints. Praying to the patron saints of farmers isn't much different than praying to the god of rain. The central tension with monotheism is how to deal with the fact that there is evil in the world while the omnipoten God is believed to be good and caring. If God is good why would he allow evil things to happen? Even the rich and famous are rarely satisfied. According to Buddhist tradition: the mind naturally craves more in all situations. And all suffering arrives from craving. There are a variety of “natural law religions” that are popular today like communism, capitalism, and liberalism. Over the last 200 years, science has increasingly revealed that human behavior is determined by hormones, genes, and neurological synapses. If this is true, then for how much longer will we ignore that biology does not agree with the concept of free will? To describe how something happened means to reconstruct the series of specific events that led from one point to another. To describe why something happened means to find causal connections that led to this particular series of events to the exclusion of all others. The deeper your knowledge of a particular area of history, the harder it becomes to explain why one particular outcome occurred and not another. It is an inevitable rule of history that what seems obvious in hindsight is impossible to predict beforehand. The are level one and level two Chaotic Systems. Level one does not respond to predictions about it, like the weather and weather forecasts. Level two does respond to predictions about it, like the stock market and analyst reports about rising oil prices. There is no proof that history is working for the benefit of humans or that human well being increases overtime. It's good for the victors, but is it good for us all? The Scientific Revolution started in Europe around 500 years ago. The last 500 years have witnessed an unprecedented growth of human impact. One difference between religion and science is that science assumes humankind does not know the answers to many of life's biggest questions. Religion, however, assumes that the important stuff is already known. Science assumes human ignorance. Modern culture has been able to admit ignorance more than any previous culture. Previous cultures and belief systems compiled their theories using stories. Science compiles its theories using mathematics. The story of how Scottish Widows was founded is an awesome example of the power of probability. Scientists generally agree that no theory is 100 percent correct. Thus, the real test of knowledge is not truth, but utility. Science gives us power. The more useful that power, the better the science. The military arms race drives science forward in rapid fashion. The truth is war prompts many scientific discoveries. In the past, the best minds of the day worked on finding ways to give meaning to death. Today, our best minds work on preventing death through biological, hormonal, and genetic means. Science does not take death as an inevitability. The economic, religious, and political interests that impact the flow of money into scientific and technological research have a huge impact on the output of science. It is not enough to consider science in a vacuum. Economic and capitalistic interests, for example, determine what we research and what to do with the research findings. Why did Europeans discover and conquer the Americas? Why not the Chinese or those from India or the Middle East who possessed just as much knowledge and technology as the Europeans? The European ideology to explore the world was the primary difference. For most of human history, per capita production remained the same. Since the launch of capitalism, however, per capita production has skyrocketed. Modern capitalism has exploded the growth of humankind thanks to the creation of credit, which allows you to borrow money now because we collectively trust that the future will be better than the present. Adam Smith's brilliant insight about capitalism in The Wealth of Nations was that increasing private profits is the basis for increasing collective wealth and prosperity. In other words, by becoming richer you benefit everyone, not just yourself. Both parties get a bigger slice of pie. (Note: this only works if profits get reinvested, not hoarded.) For capitalism to work, profits must be reinvested in new production. The “religion” of capitalism says economic growth is the supreme because justice, freedom, and happiness requires economic growth. All credit is based on the idea that science and technology will advance. Scientists ultimately foot the bill of capitalism. The annual sugar intake of the average Englishman rose from nearly zero in the early 17th century to 18 pounds in the early 19th century. The life expectancy, child mortality, and calorie intake are significantly improved for the average person in 2014 compared to 1914, despite exponential population growth. Until the industrial revolution, human behavior was largely dictated by solar energy and plant growth. Day and night. Summer and winter. Everything was determined by man power and animal power, which were determined by food, which is determined by photosynthesis. “This is the basic lesson of evolutionary psychology: a need shaped in the wild continues to be felt subjectively even if it is no longer really necessary for survival and reproduction.” Harlow's infant monkey studies from the 1950s (and a variety of followup studies) have shown that animals have strong psychological needs as well as purgative physical needs. Note to self: never disregard your psychological needs. Each year the United States population spends more money on diets than the amount needed to feed all the hungry in the rest of the world. Most people don't realize just how peaceful of the times are we live in. In recent years, more people die from suicide each year than from war and violent crime. The same can said for car accidents. Live a safe community, drive as little as possible, and love yourself. Violent local crime, car accidents, and suicide are some of the biggest killers of humans. War is at an all time low because the costs of war have increased because of nuclear weapons, the benefits of war have decreased because physical resources drive less of the economy and international trade is more lucrative than conquest, and the tightening of international connections because a worldwide culture is less likely to battle itself. Our view of the past is heavily influenced by recent events. Researchers have investigated nearly all aspects of history, but have rarely have asked whether historical changes have made humans happier. Nietzsche: “He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.” If happiness is based on pleasurable feelings, then increasing our happiness is a matter of increases biochemical release. If happiness is based on meaning, then increasing our happiness is a matter of deluding ourselves about the meaning of our lives. One uncommonly cited benefit of religion: belief in the afterlife gives meaning to your life in the present. Buddhism has studied happiness for over 2,000 years. Interestingly, Buddhism shares many viewpoints on happiness with science. Most notably, that happiness results from processes within the body and not from the outside world. The Buddhist philosophy of happiness centers around the idea that you are not the events that happen to you, but you are also not the feelings you have. You are not your feelings. They are just feelings. Thus, if you understand this, you can release the needs to keep chasing the need to feel happy or to not feel angry or to not feel sad. In other words, you have to understand yourself. For close to 4 billion years, every organism developed according to evolution. But in recent decades, humans have begun to evolve according to intelligent design. In other words, there are people who would have been selected out of the gene pool millennia ago, but not today. Genetic engineering is allowing humans to break the laws of natural selection. The next stage of human history will not only involve biological and technological changes, but also changes in human consciousness and identity. Changes that are this fundamental will call the very term “human” into question. Many people think the question we should ask to guide our scientific pursuits is, “What do we want to become?” However, because we seem to be on the path to genetically engineering and programming nearly every facets of our wants, desires, and consciousness, the real question we should ask is, “What do we want to want?” In the past 1000 years, humans have evolved to take over the world and are on the verge of overcoming natural selection and becoming gods. Yet, we still seem unhappy in many ways and we are unsure of what we want. Is there anything more dangerous that dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want?"
The Nurture Assumption by Judith Rich Harris,"The two classic drivers of human development are nature (genes) and nurture (environment). Many people mistakenly believe nurture only refers to how parents raise their children. Although children do learn things from their parents, they learn far more from their peers. The world that children share with their peer group is what shapes their behavior, modifies the characteristics they were born with, and determines the sort of people they will be when they grow up.","The two classical drives of human development have been thought to be nature and nurture, genes and environment. The nurture assumption is that, aside from their genes, what influences the way children develop is the way their parents bring them up. In other words, we assume parents are the whole environment, when in reality the environment includes much more. Fascinating: before Freud and behaviorism, clinical psychology books didn't even talk about parental impact on children. It wasn't until Freud that parental nurture exploded onto the scene. In many ways, children do not imitate their parents. They don't drive cars, light matches, leave home whenever they please, and so on. You'll also notice many kids of immigrants don't have accents while their parents do. If you start out thinking there is a “good” and a “bad” approach to anything, then you are clouding you judgment. You have to release your attachment to certain sides of the argument and start with a blank slate if you want to discover the truth. In general, you should put little stock in correlation research and trust experiments much more. (Most child psychology research is correlational. Child psychologists usually look for trends rather than setting up experiments.) There are two correlations that show up often enough that we can say they are true (although they may not be particularly strong). First, parents who do a good job of managing their lives and dealing with problems generally have children who do the same. Second, child who are shown love and affection are likely to grow up with cordial, well-adjusted relationships. Overall, heredity accounts for approximately 50 percent of behavioral differences among people. Environment accounts for the other 50 percent. Children come into the world already different from one another thanks to their genes. Then, parents treat their children differently precisely because they think and act in different ways. Genetics leads to different parenting styles. Identical twins raised on the same home are no more alike than identical twins raised in different homes. Both sets of twins have small personalities and small differences. It appears genetics accounts for nearly all the differences. If parents treat different children in different ways, are they simply responding to genetic differences in the children? Or are they causing differences by the different treatment they give each child? Birth order is one factor that produces very different micro-environments for each child to develop in. Any differences in personality are known as birth order effects. Interestingly, researchers have found no link between birth order and behavioral differences. The problem many of these socialization issues run into is what Karl Popper cited: you can’t prove it, but more importantly you can’t disprove it. You can’t call something science if there is no way to test whether or not it is false. All people behavior differently in different situations. This is true even of babies. What you learn in one context will not necessarily work in another. Most children have at least two distinct environments: the home and the world outside the home. The patterns of behavior acquired in the family are often different from the patterns of behavior acquired with peers. A parent’s behavior toward a child impacts how the child behaves in the presence of the parent or in contexts that are associated with the parent. One of the book’s key points: although children do learn things from their parents, they do not only learn things from their parents. People tend to be drawn to others like themselves. For example, it is likely your childhood friend will the same age, sex, race, and have similar values. It is worth noting that children and adults are very unlike each other in size, intelligence, power, freedom and more. “It takes a village to raise a child.” But only because you need a village to have a large enough play group. The bulk of child socialization occurs within the play group with their peers. Laughter is the favorite weapon of the group. It is used by kids around the world to keep others in line with their expectations and norms. Research found that peer acceptance or rejection was associated with overall life status adjustment in adulthood. However, having or not having friends during grade school was not associated with life status adjustment in adulthood. Social comparison is a key part of discovering and finding yourself, regardless of what your friendships look like. Margaret Mead’s definition of culture: “The systematic body of learned behavior which is transmitted from parents to children.” This definition is correct about learned behaviors being passed down, but mistakenly assumes this process only occurs from parents to children. Cultures are not passed on from parents to children. We know this because children of immigrant parents adopt the culture of their peers. This means neither the parent’s child rearing methods nor the imitation of the parents by the child are dominant factors in passing on culture. Cultures are not passed on by all of the adults in a society. We know this because cases where children are of a different culture than the adults (for example, deaf children) take on the culture of their peers and not the culture of the adults. Thus, the society-wide adult culture is not a dominant factor in passing on culture. According to the author, cultures are passed on by the children’s peer group. She calls this “group socialization theory.” The world that children share with their peers is what shapes their behavior and modifies the characteristics they were born with and, hence, determines the sort of people they will be when they grow up. A child’s goal is not to become a successful adult no more than a prisoner’s goal is to become a successful guard. A child’s goal is to be a successful child. Thus, the influence of peers is stronger than the influence of adults. Your power to influence your children’s friendships drops significantly over time. Once they are 10 years old, you have very little influence over their peer group. One of the best strategies parents have at their disposal for influencing their kids is to move to a different school district. This often hurts kids who rely on their peer group for good standing, but if the kid is beaten down by other kids and his status amongst peers is zero, then he has very little to lose. Like other aspects of personality, self-esteem is tied to the social context through which it was acquired. A person can feel good about herself with friends and bad about herself at home, or vice versa. Self-esteem is a function of ones status in their peer group. Low status in the peer group can wreck a person’s personality. The parents have limited control over the child within the peer group, but one way they can influence peer group status is by making sure their children look normal and attractive. Normal and attractive means wearing the clothes other kids are wearing, getting braces, or going to the dermatologist to treat acne. We drastically underestimate the fact that children are born different. We do not appreciate the genetic differences enough. The main reason babies become smart adult is not because their parents read to them or hang fancy mobiles above their head (if so, our ancient ancestors would never become intelligent). It is because smart babies come from smart parents and thus have smart genes. Sleep training is a completely cultural construct and a product of our modern society. Babies never slept in separate rooms until recently. In hunter gatherer societies, a crying baby would never be left alone. It was always with the tribe. It is not natural to let your baby cry. It is natural to let it sleep with the parent. Is there an evolutionary reason why parenting should be hard? It doesn't seem so. In fact, parenting should be easy and pleasurable. This would ensure we would want to parent our offspring. Maybe if parenting is a chore, you're working too hard at it. Our society is obsessed with equality and fairness, but there is nothing about nature that states equality must be the rule. In fact, it is far more natural to have inequality in some cases. Quality time is an interesting concept. Most kids prefer to spend quality time with their peers, not their parents. And yet, parents are supposed to feel guilty if they don’t spend enough time with their kids. Parenting is a job where sincerity and hard work do not guarantee success. Through no fault of their own, good parents sometimes have bad kids. Love your kids because kids are lovable, not because some expert prescribes it. You can neither perfect nor ruin your kids, they are not yours to perfect or ruin. Just love them."
When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi,"The memoir of Paul Kalanithi, a neurosurgeon at Stanford University, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in his mid-thirties. Kalanithi uses the pages in this book to not only tell his story, but also share his ideas on how to approach death with grace and what it means to be fully alive.","On the suffering that often accompanies death: “With what strife and pains we come into the world we know not, but ’tis commonly no easy matter to get out of it.” -Sir Thomas Browne, Religio Medici I realized that the questions intersecting life, death, and meaning, questions that all people face at some point, usually arise in a medical context. Because the brain mediates our experience of the world, any neurosurgical problem forces a patient and family, ideally with a doctor as a guide, to answer this question: What makes life meaningful enough to go on living? Learning to judge whose lives could be saved, whose couldn’t be, and whose shouldn’t be requires an unattainable prognostic ability. I made mistakes. Rushing a patient to the OR to save only enough brain that his heart beats but he can never speak, he eats through a tube, and he is condemned to an existence he would never want… I came to see this as a more egregious failure than the patient dying. As a resident, my highest ideal was not saving lives—everyone dies eventually—but guiding a patient or family to an understanding of death or illness. One of the earliest meanings of the word “patient” is “one who endures hardship without complaint.” When you take up another’s cross, you must be willing to sometimes get crushed by its weight. “Boredom is the awareness of time passing.” -Heidegger The pain of failure had led me to understand that in neurosurgery technical excellence was a moral requirement. Good intentions were not enough, not when so much depended on my skills, when the difference between tragedy and triumph was defined by one or two millimeters. Death comes for all of us. It is our fate as living, breathing, metabolizing organisms. Dealing with the fact of death is unsettling. Yet there is no other way to live. Can we become comfortable with the most uncomfortable thing in the world—death? If the weight of mortality does not grow lighter, does it at least grow more familiar? As a doctor, I was an object, a cause. As a patient, I was merely something to which things happened. Life isn’t about avoiding suffering. The defining characteristic of an organism is striving. “Even if I’m dying, until I actually die, I’m still living.” The tricky thing about terminal illness (and life, probably) is your values are constantly changing. You try to figure out what matters to you and then you keep figuring it out. How do you decide what to do with your life when you’re not sure how much life you have left? Maybe in the absence of certainty we should just assume we’re going to live a long time. Maybe that’s the only way forward. If you believe that science provides no basis for God, then you are almost obligated to conclude that science provides no basis for meaning and, therefore, life itself doesn’t have any. No system of thought can contain the fullness of human experience. Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete. “I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the work, and you are sharing the fruits of their labor.” -The Bible Graham Greene once said that life was lived in the first twenty years and the rest was just reflection. Most ambitions are either achieved or abandoned; either way, they belong to the past. What happened to Paul was tragic, but he was not a tragedy."
Superhuman by Habit by Tynan,"You can do just about anything if you break down the task into habits. You are more likely to stick with good habits over the long run if you start with tiny habits that are incredibly easy in the beginning. When you miss a habit once, getting back on track and sticking with the next occurrence of that habit should become the top priority in your life.","Habits allow you to stick with behaviors that would require a lot of willpower as a one-time attempt, but only need a little willpower to remain a habit. Whenever you're going to not do a habit, explain to your brain why you're missing. Absolutely never skip twice. Missing two days of a habit is like habit suicide. When you miss a habit once, sticking with the next occurrence of that habit should become the top priority in your life. Plan for failure. Figure out why you missed a habit and plan solutions in advance. Plan for variances in habits ahead of time. “I won't follow my normal workout routine when I go on my trip to Europe. So I will do 20 push-ups per day while I'm there and then return immediately to my previous workout routine once I get home.” When you don't feel like doing a habit, do a crappy job. If you beat yourself up every time you miss a habit, you are basically ruining the whole purpose of the experience. Habits are supposed to make your life better. Hating yourself for missing a habit introduces negativity that completely offsets the positive benefits. (Note: we could use a finance metaphor here. Getting a new credit card to earn a bunch of frequent flier miles is pointless if you don't pay off the balance each month. The negatives offset any positive gain. Same situation here with habits.) Use your mistakes to focus. They are an indicator of where to direct your energy. There is no guarantee of success once you introduce your habits into the outside world. But, you can control your behavior, so focus on the process not the results. It is best to always assume that it is your fault. We are quick to claim to be the victim, but not quick enough to claim responsibility. (Note: when we lose our job, we assume it's the economy. When we don't get a job, we assume it's because we don't have the right network. We make all sorts of assumptions. If you're going to assume something, assume it's your fault. There is always something more you could have done.) When you mistreat others, feel guilty. When you mistreat yourself, feel compassion. You can do just about anything if you break down the task into habits. There are two types of people: those who find it easier to add new habits into their life and those who find it easier to cut habits out of their life. (Note: you may find it varies by habit. Attack your habits from both sides.) If you're not going to follow through on a habit, it is better to not start it at all and focus on a habit you can actually stick to instead. In many situations it is better to try and fail than to not try at all. Not so with habits. It is better to try a small one and stick with it than to try a big one and fail. (Note: this is because all the benefit of habits comes from the long-term consistency.) Note: most people optimize for the finish line. Goals, outcomes, milestones, deadlines. Instead you should optimize for the starting line. Reducing friction, etc. Learning how to build new habits is useful because you can translate the skills you learn to new habits. That's one reason why building an incredibly simple habit is still worthwhile. The way you live your normal day is full of triggers for possible habits. Doing something occasionally or whenever you feel like it is an inconsistent hobby. Doing it on a predictable schedule is a habit. First you need to acknowledge your bad habit. Then you need to develop a specific plan to solve the problem. Chain your habits together with the easiest habits at the beginning. Make it really easy to start and let the momentum build. If you're struggling to find time and space for old and new habits, then let your old habits slide while you build the new ones. Once the new habit becomes routine you will be more likely to fall back into the routine with the old habits because you already had it mastered previously. It's a good idea to become completely accountable to yourself. There must be consequences for failure. Reserve accountability for your most important habits. It can be a logistical pain to setup accountability partners, but it works really well. If you want to grow, you have to expose yourself to high-quality influences. Only quit habits when you no longer want to quit. The time when you have lots of emotional benefit from quitting is the beginning. Expose yourself to ideas you disagree with and actually try them out. The 3 big negative habits are: 1) drugs and alcohol, 2) addiction to stimulation, 3) negative friends. It's a shame everyone else is such an idiot. Of course, to someone else, we are the idiot. Remember that everyone is just trying to do their best and be happy. Just like you. Eating healthy is perhaps the most impactful health habit you can adopt. The key elements of great sleep habits are complete darkness and silence. It takes two months of building a meditation habit before you start experiencing the benefits. Meditation creates a space between feeling an impulse and acting on it. Most people who work indoors are deficient in Vitamin D. Everything in life is either input or output. We are either creating something or consuming something. International travel, reading books, and seeking out masterpieces from all fields are some of the best ways to increase the quality of your input. Writing daily, dancing, and organization habits are some of the best ways to increase the quality of you output. For writing habits: what you write about and the quality of writing are not important. Following the habit is important. For organization habits: practice imperfect cleaning where you get your home or work space to a 9/10 cleanliness, but don't worry about perfection. Calendar habits: the critical component of a calendar habit is getting everything on the calendar. If you don't keep every single event on the calendar then you can't trust it and that defeats the purpose. Unclutter your life. If you're 90 percent sure you won't use it in the next 6-12 months, give it away. “Twice, then quit.” The first time you want to quit, don't. Push through. The second time you want to quit, don't. Push through again. The third time you want to quit, then you can stop. Eliminate starting procrastination. If you want to procrastinate on some future part of work, that's fine. But you're not allowed to procrastinate starting the behavior. You have to start right now – don't delay, plan, strategize, research, etc. Of course, if you get started you probably won't want to procrastinate later because you'll have built momentum. At this end of each day, rate yourself based on how much time you wasted and so on."
What Got You Here Won’t Get You There by Marshall Goldsmith,"Behavioral problems, not technical skills, are what separate the great from the near great. Incredible results can come from practicing basic behaviors like saying thank you, listening well, thinking before you speak, and apologizing for your mistakes. The first step to change is wanting to change.","The higher you go in an organization, the more your suggestions become interpreted as orders. Getting praise can be dangerous because it becomes easy to delude yourself when all you hear are positive things. Delusional self-confidence causes you to resist change. You can't control the outcome, but why wouldn't you want to try to control what you can? Even if the cards are stacked against you in life your best bet is to try your hardest. Successful people believe they are in control. They don't see themselves as victims of the world. Lottery ticket players: serious lottery players think success is random. Successful people think success is within their control and thus don't play the lottery. Both mindsets are delusional in their own way, but the successful approach seems to work better overall. People will only do something and change when it is in their own best interest and aligns with our values. The four drivers of self-interest: money, power, status, popularity. Smart people know what to do. They need to know what to stop. Create a To-Stop list rather than a To-Do list. Not all behavior is good or bad. Some behaviors are simply neutral. The fallacy of adding too much value is that by adding value you kill the ownership of other peoples ideas. When you add to the idea it no longer feels like it is their idea. When getting feedback of any type, positive or negative, accept it from a neutral place and say, “Thank you.” If you don't reply with a judgmental comment, you can't get into an argument. The question to ask yourself when making a destructive or critical comment about someone is not, “Is it true?” But, “Is it worth it?” Don't tell people how smart you are. Nobody gives a damn. Withholding information is a problem for me when I don't communicate well. If you don't communicate what is going on it feels like you're keeping people in the dark. That annoys people. Create a list of people you should give recognition to and then review that list each week to see if you should send someone praise. Give away ALL the credit. Clinging to the past: “Many people enjoy living in the past, especially if going back there lets them blame someone else for anything that's gone wrong in their lives. That's when clinging to the past becomes an interpersonal problem… When we make excuses, we are blaming someone or something beyond our control as the reason for our failure. Anyone but ourselves.” When we talk about the past it is NOT about change. It is about understanding. And often about blaming others. Just say “Thank You” to more comments rather than making a bigger fuss about things. We often have issues with accepting compliments. Hearing people out does not make you dumber. So listen and say thank you. Gratitude is not a limited resource. Express your thanks more often. People who think they can do no wrong usually can't admit they are ever wrong. Which, paradoxically, makes you more wrong. Owning up to your mistakes is essential. Your personality is not fixed and improvement does not require you to become a radically different person. You don't have to change your whole life, just improve one tiny trait. Goal obsession is the blindness of goal pursuit at the expense of more important things. You should feel no shame if your pursuit of a difficult goal fails. Goal obsession is not a flaw, it is a creator of flaws. Princeton theology students research study and the story of the Good Samaritan. Goal obessions: we are so focus on shortsighted goals and the task in front of us that we miss the bigger point. Use this as a jumping off point for talking about goals in life. Is working really the point? Main lesson: you can do a lot worse than questioning your flaws. We often get so defensive about these things, but what do we really have to lose? Usually, very little. Forgiveness means letting go of the hope for a better past. The higher you go the more your problems are behavioral. Interpersonal behavior is the difference between being great and near great. Knowing the answer to, “How do you feel about me?” does not matter when it comes to getting better. What matters is, “How can I get better?” Apologize, apologize, apologize. Just step up and make the apologies you need to make. When you make an apology say, “I'm sorry. I'll try to do better.” And then shut up. Don't try to justify it. Frances Hesselbein, CEO of the Girl Scouts. Claimed to be greatest executive by Peter Drucker. When you listen to someone make them feel like they are the only person in the room. Devote your attention to them. We can't change for the long-run without following up. Follow up shows your colleagues that you care about getting better and that you're taking the process seriously."
Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott,"To become a better writer, you have to write more. Writing reveals the story because you have to write to figure out what you're writing about. Don't judge your initial work too harshly because every writer has terrible first drafts.","Write shitty first drafts. “We all know we're going to die; what's important is the kind of men and women we are in the face of this.” “All you can give us is what life is about from your point of view.” “You must assume that we, your readers, are bright and attentive, even if we have lost the tiniest bit of ground in the last few years. So we are going to catch you if you try to fake it.” Writing reveals itself through writing. As you write, you uncover the hidden gems inside you that you didn't even know were there. Words come to you, characters reveals themselves, and dialogue forms that shows who these people are. It pretty much always works this way: you have to write to figure out what you're writing about. Ask people around you to help you with your writing. Call on them for their expertise. If you want to write about gardening or include a garden in your writing, but you don't know the first thing about gardening, then ask someone who does. Enlist the help of others to make your words come alive."
Anything You Want by Derek Sivers,"Too many people spend their life pursuing things that don't actually make them happy. When you make a business, you get to make a little universe where you create all the laws. Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers.","Sivers sold his business, which he spent 10 years growing, for $22 million. Too many people spend their life pursuing things that don't actually make them happy. Never do anything just for the money. Instead, just answer calls for help. You don't really know what you want until you start doing it. Sivers was a professional musician before he started his business. It all started because he wanted to sell his own CD on his website. Pretty soon he was selling CDs for lots of musicians and CD Baby was born. When you make a business, you get to make a little universe where you create all the laws. When you're onto something great it won't feel like something great. It will feel like uncommon sense. If it's not a hit, switch. Success comes from consistently improving and inventing. Don't waste years pursing anything other than a hit. Hell yeah or no. If it's not a hell yes, then decline. Say yes to less. “No plan survives first contact with customers.”  -Steve Blank Only please customers, not investors. Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers. The way to grow your business is to just focus entirely on your current customers. Just thrill them and they will tell everyone else. Ideas are just a multiplier of execution. The most brilliant idea is worthless with no execution. There is a huge advantage in having many tiny customers. You can fire any individual client as long as you keep your customers happy in general. Your first idea is just one of an infinite number of options. Make plans for many different scenarios. There is no one path to success. How do you grade yourself? You should know what matters most to you. Care about your customers more than yourself. Your company should be willing to go out of business if it's best for your customers. Be incredibly clear in your writing. Leave no room for confusion. Even if you want to be big, you don't have to act like a big boring business. Learn things yourself. It will take longer, but it is nice to be self sufficient. There is joy in learning and doing. You don't sign up for a marathon and hire a taxi to drive you to the finish line. The real point is what you want to be, not have. There is a big difference between being self employed and being a business owner. When you're self employed everything crumbles if you don't show up. You're not a business owner until you can leave for a year and your business is doing even better when you come back. Never forget that you can make your role anything you want. You can hire for everything else. You might be much happier as a million dollar business than as a billion dollar business. Always trust, but verify whenever you delegate a role. A business is a reflection of the creator. Pay close attention to what excites you and what drains you. Whatever you make, it's your creation. Make it your dream come true."
Born Standing Up by Steve Martin,"Steve Martin was one of the most successful comedians of his generation. In his words, his career involved “10 years spent learning, 4 years spent refining, and 4 years spent in wild success.” This fantastic book provided beautiful insights not only into the details of his comedy act, but also into his early life and career development.","Martin did stand up for 18 years. In his words, “10 years spent learning, 4 years spent refining, and 4 years spent in wild success.” Darkness is essential for stand up success. Audiences don't laugh when they are in the light. All entertainment is, or is about to be, old fashioned. There is always room for something new. Perseverance is a great substitute for talent. Practice, practice, practice. The early years of Martin's career were poor and unsexy, but they were filled with tons of practice. It was by performing his routines in public five or six times per day and by constantly adapting material from friends that he developed stage confidence and a unique routine. He is the definition of The Helsinki Bus Station Theory. So many of his acts started as something learned from a friend or adapted from a coworker. Eventually, he stayed on the bus long enough to transform what he learned into his own routine. It is fascinating how he slowly expanded his shoe length with each gig. His early jobs were short routines or magic tricks of a few minutes. Then he did a five minute skit or a ten minute show at a club. Then he took on a twenty minute gig and even added in three poems to read just to add enough length. It's an awesome example of taking on just manageable difficulties. Martin began as a magician but discovered that what he loved was not magic, but performance. That's when he set his sights on becoming a comedian. It wasn't until college that Martin realized he needed to come up with entirely original content. “Through the years, I have learned that there is no harm in charging oneself up with delusions between moments of valid inspiration.” Any new philosophy, even if wrong in some respects, is good for creativity. Teaching people, whether in a classroom or otherwise, is a form of show business. It is interesting how Martin is convinced the success of his comedy act was largely dependent on the current events of the time (his act balanced the seriousness of the Vietnam War, in particular). On the one hand, I think he undersells himself as a comedian. I'm confident he could be funny in any era. On the other hand, I appreciate his acknowledgement of luck and timing in his success. Never let the audience know you are bombing. “This is funny, you just haven’t gotten it yet.” Keep going even if the laughs aren’t coming. For eight years he tried this routine and it didn’t work well. One piece of feedback said he was, “The most serious booking error in the history of Los Angeles music.” His agent told Martin to “stick to writing” because his performance was not going to work. “I had never really imagined success, I was just trying to be a performer.” Martin gave himself a deadline for success. He would be a performer until he was 30 and then had to figure out something else to do. Martin doesn’t brag about his relationships with a variety of women, but one thing is pretty clear: women love men who are funny. “It was easy to be great. Every entertainer has a night when everything is clicking. These nights are accidental and statistical. Like lucky cards in poker, you can count on them occurring over time. What was hard was to be good. Consistently good. Night after night. No matter what the abominable circumstances.” “As I continued to work, my material grew. I came up with odd little gags, such as, “How many people have never raised their hands before?” I was now capable of doing two different 25-minute sets per evening in case some of the audience stayed for the second show.” “Because I was generally unknown, in the smaller venues I was free to gamble with material.” “My act was becoming simultaneously smart and stupid.” By his late 20s, Martin had reached a point where he was a successful opening act and would appear on televisions shows (including The Tonight Show) on a routine basis, but he was never opening. He realized that the audience never came for the opening act. People only cared about the headliner. And so, he set a rule to only headline and never open. Within a year, he was completely broke. Even after being on The Tonight Show and starting to headline a few clubs (but without any mainstream success), Martin wrote in his journal, “My new material is hopelessly poor. My act is simply not good enough. It’s not even bad.” It is fascinating to see such a successful creator struggle with his work. After 12 years of performing, he finally reached the point where he could afford to only do one show per night rather than three, four, or five shows per night scattered across town. Right after Martin became famous, he was driving through Beverly Hills with his mother and said, “Get out and walk down the street so I can watch people look at you.” His first album sold 1.5 million copies in 1977. At his peak, Martin’s tour schedule was insane. 60 cities in 63 days. 72 in 80 days. 85 cities in 90 days. 18,695 people attended one show in Ohio. 45,000 tickets sold for his show in New York. He became the biggest concert comedian in show business, ever. Small insight: during his rise to fame Martin was always surprised by the size of his crowds. One possible interpretation was that he was relatively unaware of how many people each venue could hold, which meant he didn't handle the booking and business side of things. This seems obvious, but it is a critical point: he was 100 percent focused on his craft. Once he achieved peak success, he struggled with trying new material and experimentation. In his words, “This was no longer an experiment. I felt a huge responsibility not to let people down. Arenas of 20,000 and three day gigs of 45,000 were no place to try new material.” By 1979, he was already booked for the next two years. Martin became so famous that he couldn’t go outside without tons of hoopla and, interestingly, his romantic life vanished. He couldn’t interact with people in a normal way and just spent his time shuttling from show to hotel room and back. He went into a depression. “This was the loneliest period of my life.” During the height of his fame, Martin would have people chase him down on the highway, drive their car with one hand while waving the other out the window and screaming, “I’m a wild and crazy guy!” in reference to his Saturday Night Life bit. There is definitely a point where you can become too popular. Your daily life is hindered. Your relationships suffer. People struggle to understand your troubles. Celebrity has its drawbacks. Martin toured for five straight years with sold out venues. “Then, I saw something in the back I hadn’t seen in years. Empty seats.” “If you have anything to work out with your parents, do it now. One day it will be too late.” I agree with Martin that it is not your job to judge the success of your own work: “I do not know if my act holds up all these years later. It is not for me to decide or even think about.”"

","Johnstone’s work has been to rediscover the imaginative response in adults and to rekindle the power of children’s creativity. Johnstone banished aimless discussion from meetings and turned them into enactment sessions. It was what happened that mattered, not what anybody said about it.  You are not imaginatively impotent until you are dead. You are only frozen up.  On the perils of learning creative principles: Dullness is not the consequence of age, but of education. As we learn creative principles like composition and balance, we start seeing the world as it ought to be rather than as it is. The problem is that the world as it is, is actually far more interesting than the version our educated minds wish it to be. We have to relearn how to attend to the world as it is rather than being disappointed for it not perfectly matching the rules we have been taught. Whenever you hear something, you should reverse it and see if the opposite is also true. Never believe something merely because it is convenient. Normal education is designed to reduce spontaneity and make things orderly and understood. Johnstone’s theater improvisation teaching techniques were designed to do exactly the opposite. People insist on categorizing and selecting. We are always choosing the best, the top, the most, the biggest, the smallest. Is this necessary? On writing fluently: inspiration isn’t intellectual and you don’t have to be perfect. When you write and write and write and edit and edit and edit, you become so constrained that you lose flow. On the perils of intelligence: I accepted the idea that my intelligence was the most important part of me. I tried to be clever in everything I did. In the end, I was reluctant to attempt anything for fear of failure. My first thoughts never seemed good enough. Everything had to be corrected and brought into line. Maybe school teaches us not to respond in a natural way, but to respond in a muted way. We unconsciously learn to copy our teachers. To act like we’ve been there before. To cross our arms, fold our legs, and lean back from the book or the film, rather than into it. On the stupidity of judging people based on their intelligence: I learned to value people for their actions, rather than their thoughts. gradually I realised that I wouldn't work for people I didn't like. I'd argue that a director should never demonstrate anything to an actor, that a director should allow the actor to make his own discoveries, that the actor should think he'd done all the work himself. I objected to the idea that the director should work out the moves before the production started. I said that if an actor forgot a move that had been decided on, then the move was probably wrong. The authors of the pseudo-plays assumed that writing should be based on other writing, not on life. I began to think of children not as immature adults, but of adults as atrophied children. We learned that things invented on the spur of the moment could be as good or better than the texts we laboured over. the bulk of discussion time is visibly taken up with transactions of status which have nothing to do with the problem to be solved. My attitude is like Edison's, who found a solvent for rubber by putting bits of rubber in every solution he could think of, and beat all those scientists who were approaching the problem theoretically. Lacking solutions, I had to find my own. combining the imagination of two people which would be additive, rather than subtractive. After a while a pattern is established in which each performance gets better and better until the audience is like a great beast rolling over to let you tickle it. Then hubris gets you, you lose your humility, you expect to be loved, and you turn into Sisyphus. What really got me started again was an advert for a play of mine in the paper, a play called The Martian. I had never written such a play, so I phoned up Bryan King, who directed the theatre. ‘We've been trying to find you,' he said. ‘We need a play for next week, does the title The Martian suit you?' I wrote the play, and it was well received. Since then I've deliberately put myself in this position. I simply approach each problem on a basis of common sense and try to find the most obvious solutions possible. My feeling is that a good teacher can get results using any method, and that a bad teacher can wreck any method. The first thing I do when I meet a group of new students is (probably) to sit on the floor. I play low status, and I'll explain that if the students fail they're to blame me. Then they laugh, and relax, and I explain that really it's obvious that they should blame me, since I'm supposed to be the expert; and if I give them the wrong material, they'll fail; and if I give them the right material, then they'll succeed. I play low status physically but my actual status is going up, since only a very confident and experienced person would put the blame for failure on himself. At this point they almost certainly start sliding off their chairs, because they don't want to be higher than me. I have already changed the group profoundly, because failure is suddenly not so frightening any more. They'll want to test me, of course; but I really will apologise to them when they fail, and ask them to be patient with me, and explain that I'm not perfect. My methods are very effective, and other things being equal, most students will succeed, but they won't be trying to win any more. The normal teacher-student relationship is dissolved. I've also trained myself to make positive comments, and to be as direct as possible. I say ‘Good' instead of'That's enough'. Wolpe relaxed his phobic patients and then presented them with a very dilute form of the thing that scared them. Someone terrified of birds might be asked to imagine a bird, but one in Australia. At the same time that the image was presented, the patient was relaxed, and the relaxation was maintained (if it wasn't maintained, if the patient started to tremble, or sweat or whatever, then something even less alarming would be presented). Relaxation is incompatible with anxiety; and by maintaining the relaxed state, and presenting images that gradually neared the centre of the phobia, the state of alarm was soon dissipated—in most cases. An exercise: fix your eyes on some object, and attend to something at the periphery of your vision. You can see what you're attending to, but actually your mind is assembling the object from relatively little information. Now look directly, and observe the difference. This is one way of tricking the mind out of its habitual dulling of the world. Suddenly we understood that every inflection and movement implies a status, and that no action is due to chance, or really ‘motiveless'. Status is a confusing term unless it's understood as something one does. You may be low in social status, but play high, and vice versa. The messages are modified by the receivers. Every movement, every inflection of the voice implies a status. Kings and lords used to surround themselves with dwarfs and cripples so could rise by the contrast. Some modern celebrities do the same. A comedian is someone paid to lower his own or other people's status. In my view the man who falls on the banana skin is funny only if he loses status, and if we don't have sympathy with him. Tragedy also works on the see-saw principle: its subject is the ousting of a high-status animal from the pack. When a very high-status person is wiped out, everyone feels pleasure as they experience the feeling of moving up a step. Social animals have inbuilt rules which prevent them each other for food, mates, and so on. Such animals confront eachother, and sometimes fight, until a hierarchy is established, after which there is no fighting unless an attempt is being made to change the ‘pecking order'. In animals the pattern of eye contacts often establishes dominance. Dark glasses raise status because we can't see the submission of the eyes. Those who hold eye contacts report that they feel powerful—and actually look powerful. Those who break eye contact and glance back ‘feel' feeble, and look it. I might then begin to insert a tentative ‘er' at the beginning of each of my sentences, and ask the group if they detect any change in me. They say that I look ‘helpless' and ‘weak' but they can't, interestingly enough, say what I'm doing that's different. I don't normally begin every sentence with ‘er', so it should be very obvious. Then I move the ‘er' into the middle of sentences, and they say that they perceive me as becoming a little stronger. I'm keeping my head still whenever I speak, and that this produces great changes in the way I perceive myself and am perceived by others. Moment by moment each person adjusts his status up or down a fraction. The body has reflexes that protect it from attack. We have a ‘fear-crouch' position in which the shoulders lift to protect the jugular and the body curls forward to protect the underbelly. It's more effective against carnivores than against policemen jabbing at your kidneys, but it evolved a long time ago. The opposite to this fear crouch is the ‘cherub posture', which opens all the planes of the body: the head turns and tilts to offer the neck, the shoulders turn the other way to expose the chest, the spine arches slightly backwards and twists so that the pelvis is in opposition to the shoulders exposing the underbelly—and so on. This is the position I usually see cherubs carved in, and the opening of the body planes is a sign of vulnerability and tenderness, and has a powerful effect on the onlooker. High-status people often adopt versions of the cherub posture. If they feel under attack they'll abandon it and straighten, but they won't adopt the fear crouch. Challenge a low-status player and he'll show some tendency to slide into postures related to the fear crouch. When the highest-status person feels most secure he will be the most relaxed person. People will travel a long way to visit a ‘view'. The essential clement of a good view is distance, and preferably with nothing human in the immediate foreground. We're all giving status signals, and exchanging subliminal status challenges all the time. teach that a master-servant scene is one in which both parties act as if all the space belonged to the master. (Johnstone's law!) An extreme example would be the eighteenth-century scientist Henry Cavendish, who is reported to have fired any servant he caught sight of! (Imagine the hysterical situations: servants scuttling like rabbits, hiding in grandfather clocks and ticking, getting stuck in huge vases.) I teach that a master-servant scene is one in which both parties act as if all the space belonged to the master. (Johnstone's law!) An extreme example would be the eighteenth-century scientist Henry Cavendish, who is reported to have fired any servant he caught sight of! (Imagine the hysterical situations: servants scuttling like rabbits, hiding in grandfather clocks and ticking, getting stuck in huge vases.) A servant's primary function is to elevate the status of the master. Desmond Morris, in The Human Zqo (Cape, 1969; Corgi, 1971) gives ‘ten golden rules' for people who are Number Ones. He says, ‘They apply to all leaders, from baboons to modern presidents and prime ministers.' They are: 1. You must clearly display the trappings, postures and gestures of dominance. 2. In moments of active rivalry you must threaten your subordinates aggressively. 3. In moments of physical challenge you (or your delegates) must be able forcibly to overpower your subordinates. 4. If a challenge involves brain rather than brawn you must be able outwit your subordinates. 5. You must suppress squabbles that break out between your subordinates. 6. You must reward your immediate subordinates by permitting them to enjoy the benefits of their high ranks. 7. You must protect the weaker members of the group from undue on. You must make decisions concerning the social activities of your 9. You must reassure your extreme subordinates from time to time. 10. You must take the initiative in repelling threats or attacks arising from outside your group. It is the lack of pecking-order that makes most crowd scenes look unconvincing. The ‘extras' mill about trying to look ‘real', In life, status gaps are often exaggerated to such an extent that they become comical. Heinrich Harrer met a Tibetan whose servant stood holding a spitoon in case the master wanted to spit. Queen Victoria would take her position and sit, and there had to be a chair. George the Sixth used to wear electrically heated underclothes when deerstalking, which meant a gillie had to follow him around holding the battery. Posture implies a status, then you perceive the world quite differently, and the change is probably permanent. In my view, really accomplished actors, directors, and playwrights are people with an intuitive understanding of the status transactions that govern human relationships. Once you understand that every sound and posture implies a status, then you perceive the world quite differently, and the change is probably permanent. In my view, really accomplished actors, directors, and playwrights are people with an intuitive understanding of the status transactions that govern human relationships. A good play is one which ingeniously displays and reverses the status between the characters. We are pecking-order animals and that this affects the tiniest details of our behaviour. Once we eliminate fantasy, then we have no artists. Even after his works had been exhibited in court as proof that he wasn't in his right mind, Henri Rousseau still had the stubbornness to go on painting! Many teachers think of children as immature adults. It might lead to better and more ‘respectful' teaching, if we thought of adults as atrophied children. Many ‘well adjusted' adults are bitter, uncreative frightened, unimaginative, and rather hostile people. Instead of assuming they were born that way, or that that's what being an adult entails, we might consider them as people damaged by their education and upbringing. It's not surprising that great African sculptors end up carving coffee tables, or that the talent of our children dies the moment we expect them to become adult. Once we believe that art is self-expression, then the individual can be criticised not only for his skill or lack of skill, but simply for being what he is. Imagining should be as effortless as perceiving. Imagination is as effortless as perception, unless we think it might be ‘wrong', which is what our education encourages us to believe. Then we experience ourselves as ‘imagining', as ‘thinking up an idea', but what we're really doing is faking up the sort of imagination we think we ought to have. People maintain prejudices quite effortlessly. If an improviser is stuck for an idea, he shouldn't search for one, he should trigger his partner's ability to give ‘unthought' answers. My feeling is that sanity is actually a pretence, a way we learn to behave. We keep this pretence up because we don't want to be rejected by other people—and being classified insane is to be shut out of the group in a very complete way. A Canadian study on attitudes to mental illness concluded that it was when someone's behaviour was perceived as ‘unpredictable' that the community rejected them. Sanity is a matter of interaction, rather than of one's mental processes, Laughter is a whip that keeps us in line. It's horrible to be laughed at against your will. Many students block their imaginations because they're afraid of being unoriginal. They believe they know exactly hat originality is. Many students block their imaginations because they're afraid of being unoriginal. They But the real avant-garde aren't imitating what other people are doing, or what they did forty years ago; they're solving the problems that need solving, like how to get a popular theatre with some worth-while content, and they may not look avant-garde at all! The improviser has to realise that the more obvious he is, the more original he appears. I constantly point out how much the audience like someone who is direct, and how they always laugh with pleasure at a really ‘obvious' idea. Ordinary people asked to improvise will search for some ‘original' idea because they want to be thought clever. No two people are exactly alike, and the more obvious an improviser is, the more himself he appears. If he wants to impress us with his originality, then he'll search out ideas that are actually commoner and less interesting. An artist who is inspired is being obvious. He's not making any decisions, he's not weighing one idea against another. He's accepting his first thoughts. Suppose Mozart had tried to be original? It would have been like a man at the North Pole trying to walk north, and this is true of all the rest of us. Striving after originality takes you far away from your true self, and makes your work mediocre. There is a link with status transactions here, since low-status players tend to accept, and high-status players to block. High-status players will block any action unless they feel they can control it. Then we go to the theatre, and at all points where we would say ‘No' in life, we want to see the actors yield, and say ‘Yes'. Then the action we would suppress if it happened in life begins to develop on the stage. If you'll stop reading for a moment and think of something you wouldn't want to happen to you, or to someone you love, then you'll have thought of something worth staging or filming. People with dull lives often think that their lives are dull by chance. In reality everyone chooses more or less what kind of events will happen to them by their conscious patterns of blocking and yielding. A student objected to this view by saying, ‘But you don't choose your life. Sometimes you are at the mercy of people who push you around.' I said, ‘Do you avoid such people?' ‘Oh!' she said,'I see what you mean.' Reading about spontaneity won't make you more spontaneous, but it may at least stop you heading off in the opposite direction; and if you play the exercises with your friends in a good spirit, then soon all your thinking will be transformed. The stages I try to take students through involve the realisation (1) that we struggle against our imaginations, especially when we try to be imaginative; (2) that we are not responsible for the content of our imaginations; and (3) that we are not, as we are taught to think, our ‘personalities', but that the imagination is our true self. Content lies in the structure, in what happens, not in what the characters say. Even at the level of geometrical signs ‘meaning' is ambiguous. A cross, a circle, and a swastika contain a ‘content' quite apart from those which we assign to them. The swastika is symmetrical but unbalanced: it's a good sign for power, it has a clawiness about it (cartoonists drew swastika spiders scrabbling over the face of Europe). The circle is stiller, is a much better sign for eternity, for completeness. The cross can stand for many things, for a meeting-place, for a crossroads, for a kiss, for a reed reflected in a lake, for a mast, for a sword—but it isn't meaningless just because the interpretations aren't one-for-one. Whatever a cross suggests to us it won't have the same associations as a circle, which makes a much better sign for a moon, for example, or for pregnancy. I tell improvisers to follow the rules and see what happens, and not to feel in any way responsible for the material that emerges. If you improvise spontaneously in front of an audience you have to accept that your innermost self will be revealed. The same is true of any artist. The improviser has to be like a man walking backwards. He sees where he has been, but he pays no attention to the future. When you act or speak spontaneously, you reveal your real self, as opposed to the self you've been trained to present. This is what my students do all the time. I ask them for an idea and they say ‘. .. oh . . . aahh . .. um …' as if they couldn't think of one. The brain constructs the universe for us, so how is it possible to be ‘stuck' for an idea? The student hesitates not because he doesn't have an idea, but to conceal the inappropriate ones that arrive uninvited. If I say ‘Make up a story', then most people are paralysed. If I say ‘describe a routine and then interrupt it', people see no problem. A film like The Last Detail is based on the routine of two sailors travelling across America with a prisoner whom they have to deliver to a prison. The routine is interrupted by their decision to give him a good time. The story I fantasised earlier about the bear who chased me was presumably an interruption of the routine ‘Walking through the forest'. Red Riding Hood presents an interruption of the routine ‘Taking a basket of goodies to Grandma'. Many people think of finding more interesting routines, which doesn't solve the problem. It may be interesting to have a vet rectally examining an elephant, or to show b-ain surgeons doing a particularly delicate operation, but these activities remain routines. If two lavatory attendants break a routine by starting a brain operation, or if a window cleaner begins to examine the elephant, then this is likely to generate a narrative. Conversely, two brain surgeons working as lavatory cleaners immediately sounds like part of a story. If I describe mountaineers climbing a mountain, then the routine says that they first climb it, and then they climb down, which isn't much of a story. A film of a mountain climb isn't necessarily anything more than a documentary. As a story progresses it begins to establish other routines and these in their turn have to be broken. It doesn't matter how stupidly you interrupt a routine, you will be automatically creating a narrative, and people will listen. Sometimes stories themselves become so predictable that they become routines. I once asked a girl to close her eyes while I put a coin under one of three cups. Secredy I put a coin under each cup. When I asked her to guess which cup the coin was under, she was, of course, correct. After she'd made a correct choice about six times, she was convinced I was somehow controlling her thoughts, and moved into a rather disassociated state, so I explained, and she ‘snapped out of it'. I would suggest this as a possible means of inducing hypnosis."
Letters from a Self-Made Merchant to His Son by John Graham,"This book is a series of letters written by a successful entrepreneur, John Graham, to his son offering various pieces of advice throughout the boy’s college years and early career. For example, 1) It isn’t so much knowing a whole lot, as knowing a little and how to use it that counts. 2) Putting off an easy thing makes it hard, and putting off a hard one makes it impossible. 3) A good wife doubles a man’s expenses and doubles his happiness, and that’s a pretty good investment if a fellow’s got the money to invest. And many other insights.","You’ll find that education’s about the only thing lying around loose in this world, and that it’s about the only thing a fellow can have as much of as he’s willing to haul away. Some men learn the value of money by not having any and starting out to pry a few dollars loose from the odd millions that are lying around; and some learn it by having fifty thousand or so left to them and starting out to spend it as if it were fifty thousand a year. Some men learn the value of truth by having to do business with liars; and some by going to Sunday School. Some men learn the cussedness of whiskey by having a drunken father; and some by having a good mother. Some men get an education from other men and newspapers and public libraries; and some get it from professors and parchments—it doesn’t make any special difference how you get a half-nelson on the right thing, just so you get it and freeze on to it. The first thing that any education ought to give a man is character, and the second thing is education. I know a young fellow with the right sort of stuff in him preaches to himself harder than any one else can, and that he’s mighty often switched off the right path by having it pointed out to him in the wrong way. I’m anxious that you should be a good scholar, but I’m more anxious that you should be a good clean man. Education’s a good deal like eating—a fellow can’t always tell which particular thing did him good, but he can usually tell which one did him harm. College doesn’t make fools; it develops them. It doesn’t make bright men; it develops them. A fool will turn out a fool, whether he goes to college or not, though he’ll probably turn out a different sort of a fool. It isn’t so much knowing a whole lot, as knowing a little and how to use it that counts. The sooner you adjust your spending to what your earning capacity will be, the easier they will find it to live together. I can’t hand out any ready-made success to you. It would do you no good, and it would do the house harm. There is plenty of room at the top here, but there is no elevator in the building. Pay day is always a month off for the spend-thrift, and he is never able to realize more than sixty cents on any dollar that comes to him. But a dollar is worth one hundred and six cents to a good business man, and he never spends the dollar. It’s the man who keeps saving up and expenses down that buys an interest in the concern. The boy who does anything just because the other fellows do it is apt to scratch a poor man’s back all his life. Some men learn all they know from books; others from life; both kinds are narrow. Some men learn all they know from books; others from life; both kinds are narrow. The first are all theory; the second are all practice. I wanted you to form good mental habits, just as I want you to have clean, straight physical ones. It’s not what a man does during working-hours, but after them, that breaks down his health. A clear mind is one that is swept clean of business at six o’clock every night and isn’t opened up for it again until after the shutters are taken down next morning. Putting off an easy thing makes it hard, and putting off a hard one makes it impossible. Habits rule a man’s life. On travel: Seeing the world is like charity—it covers a multitude of sins, and, like charity, it ought to begin at home. Have something to say. Say it. Stop talking. It’s all right when you are calling on a girl or talking with friends after dinner to run a conversation like a Sunday-school excursion, with stops to pick flowers; but in the office your sentences should be the shortest distance possible between periods. It’s easier to look wise than to talk wisdom. Say less than the other fellow and listen more than you talk; for when a man’s listening he isn’t telling on himself and he’s flattering the fellow who is. You’ll read a good deal about “love at first sight” in novels, and there may be something in it for all I know; but I’m dead certain there’s no such thing as love at first sight in business. A man’s got to keep company a long time, and come early and stay late and sit close, before he can get a girl or a job worth having. All he ever needed was a few hundred for a starter, and to get that he’d decide to let me in on the ground floor. I want to say right here that whenever any one offers to let you in on the ground floor it’s a pretty safe rule to take the elevator to the roof garden. I want to say right here that whenever any one offers to let you in on the ground floor it’s a pretty safe rule to take the elevator to the roof garden. I don’t know anything that a young business man ought to keep more entirely to himself than his dislikes, unless it is his likes. It’s generally expensive to have either, but it’s bankruptcy to tell about them. Superiority makes every man feel its equal. It is courtesy without condescension; affability without familiarity; self-sufficiency without selfishness; simplicity without snide. There’s no easier way to cure foolishness than to give a man leave to be foolish. And the only way to show a fellow that he’s chosen the wrong business is to let him try it. I want to say right here that the easiest way in the world to make enemies is to hire friends. Get the scent in your nostrils and keep your nose to the ground, and don’t worry too much about the end of the chase. The fun of the thing’s in the run and not in the finish. The fun of the thing’s in the run and not in the finish. Never marry a poor girl who’s been raised like a rich one. She’s simply traded the virtues of the poor for the vices of the rich without going long on their good points. To marry for money or to marry without money is a crime. There’s no real objection to marrying a woman with a fortune, but there is to marrying a fortune with a woman. While you are at it, there’s nothing like picking out a good-looking wife, because even the handsomest woman looks homely sometimes, and so you get a little variety; but a homely one can only look worse than usual. Beauty is only skin deep, but that’s deep enough to satisfy any reasonable man. (I want to say right here that to get any sense out of a proverb I usually find that I have to turn it wrong side out.) Then, too, if a fellow’s bound to marry a fool, and a lot of men have to if they’re going to hitch up into a well-matched team, there’s nothing like picking a good-looking one. You can trust a woman’s taste on everything except men; and it’s mighty lucky that she slips up there or we’d pretty nigh all be bachelors. Marrying the wrong girl is the one mistake that you’ve got to live with all your life. There’s nothing in the world sicker-looking than the grin of the man who’s trying to join in heartily when the laugh’s on him, and to pretend that he likes it. Always remember that a man who’s making a claim never underestimates his case, and that you can generally compromise It looks to me as if you were trying only half as hard as you could, and in trying it’s the second half that brings results. He knew his business. And when a fellow knows his business, he doesn’t have to explain to people that he does. It isn’t what a man knows, but what he thinks he knows that he brags about. Big talk means little knowledge. There’s a vast difference between having a carload of miscellaneous facts sloshing around loose in your head and getting all mixed up in transit, and carrying the same assortment properly boxed and crated for convenient handling and immediate delivery. Poverty never spoils a good man, but prosperity often does. It’s easy to stand hard times, because that’s the only thing you can do, but in good times the fool-killer has to do night work. Most men get cross-eyed when they come to size themselves up, and see an angel instead of what they’re trying to look at. There’s nothing that tells the truth to a woman like a mirror, or that lies harder to a man. Tact is the knack of keeping quiet at the right time; of being so agreeable yourself that no one can be disagreeable to you; of making inferiority feel like equality. A tactful man can pull the stinger from a bee without getting stung. When you make a mistake, don’t make the second one—keeping it to yourself. Own up. The time to sort out rotten eggs is at the nest. Some salesmen think that selling is like eating—to satisfy an existing appetite; but a good salesman is like a good cook—he can create an appetite when the buyer isn’t hungry. Of course, clothes don’t make the man, but they make all of him except his hands and face during business hours, and that’s a pretty considerable area of the human animal. A dirty shirt may hide a pure heart, but it seldom covers a clean skin. If you look as if you had slept in your clothes, most men will jump to the conclusion that you have, and you will never get to know them well enough to explain that your head is so full of noble thoughts that you haven’t time to bother with the dandruff on your shoulders. Appearances are deceitful, I know, but so long as they are, there’s nothing like having them deceive for us instead of against us. But it isn’t enough to be all right in this world; you’ve got to look all right as well, because two-thirds of success is making people think you are all right. A man can’t do what he pleases in this world, because the higher he climbs the plainer people can see him. Jack had enthusiasm, and enthusiasm is the best shortening for any job; it makes heavy work light. A good many young fellows envy their boss because they think he makes the rules and can do as he pleases. As a matter of fact, he’s the only man in the shop who can’t. He’s like the fellow on the tight-rope—there’s plenty of scenery under him and lots of room around him, but he’s got to keep his feet on the wire all the time and travel straight ahead. No man can ask more than he gives. A fellow who can’t take orders can’t give them. There’s no alarm clock for the sleepy man like an early rising manager; and there’s nothing breeds work in an office like a busy boss. You can’t work individuals by general rules. Every man is a special case and needs a special pill. The fellow who can’t read human nature can’t manage it. Be slow to hire and quick to fire. But when you find that you’ve hired the wrong man, you can’t get rid of him too quick. Pay him an extra month, but don’t let him stay another day. Some fellows can only see those above them, and others can only see those under them, but a good man is cross-eyed and can see both ends at once. A man’s as good as he makes himself, but no man’s any good because his grandfather was. A man who does big things is too busy to talk about them. There are two things you never want to pay any attention to—abuse and flattery. The first can’t harm you and the second can’t help you. As long as you can’t please both sides in this world, there’s nothing like pleasing your own side. There are mighty few people who can see any side to a thing except their own side. Worrying is the one game in which, if you guess right, you don’t get any satisfaction out of your smartness. A busy man has no time to bother with it. Money ought never to be the consideration in marriage, but it always ought to be a consideration. When a boy and a girl don’t think enough about money before the ceremony, they’re going to have to think altogether too much about it after; A good wife doubles a man’s expenses and doubles his happiness, and that’s a pretty good investment if a fellow’s got the money to invest. I’ve never been one who could get a great deal of satisfaction out of dreams. With most people happiness is something that is always just a day off. But I have made it a rule never to put off being happy till to-morrow."
The Lessons of History by Will and Ariel Durant,"Over the course of history, human behavior has changed, but not human nature. No matter who is in power, the rewards gradually accrue to the most clever and talented individuals. Ideas are the strongest things of all in history because they can be passed down and change the behavior of future generations—even a gun was originally an idea.","History is the most reliable path to understanding the present and anticipating the problems of the future. The aim of this book is not originality, but inclusiveness. Our knowledge of any past event is incomplete. Most history is guessing and the rest is prejudice. The historian always oversimplifies. The rate of change increases and inventions cause acceleration to go ever faster. History cannot be a science, only an industry, an art, and a philosophy. An industry by ferreting out the facts. An art by seeking order in the chaos of materials. A philosophy by seeking perspective and understanding. Total perspective is an optical illusion. We must operate with partial knowledge. Only a fool would try to compress 100 centuries into 100 pages of conclusions. We proceed. History is a combination of the crimes and absurdities of humankind and the parting contributions. This enabled each generation to proceed with a greater heritage than the one before. Idea: The contributions and improvement of humankind is the story of humankind. Our story is the story of collective learning. So, let me tell you a story. Idea: there are three worlds. The first world is the external world. The second world was born when thoughts became possible and consciousness emerged. The third world emerged when our lives became digital. We can now live in a world where we are not physically there and it is not in our thoughts, but it exists. Other sciences tell us how we might behave. History tells us how we have behaved. The present is merely the past rolled up into this present moment. You are what you are because of your past. We know 1,000 things about the news of today, but rarely about the past. How can we understand our present without knowing our history? Example of technology wild gamble: the invention of airplanes totally redefines the world of trade and commerce. Previously, water was the primary mode of trade and it dictated which nations rose to power (those with large shorelines like Greece and Italy). Then, suddenly, airplanes shifted the power to nations with huge land masses in comparison to their coasts (USA, China, Russia). The lesson of history is that man is tough. History is the map of human character. To know how man will act you must know how man has acted. Humans will always be nobler than the universe. Despite dying after a mere blip of time, we know of our existence while the universe knows nothing of its longevity. The influence of geographic factors diminishes as technology grows. Man, not the earth, makes civilization. Idea: Technology overpowers environment as time goes on. This trend, however, started as soon as man was able to fashion tools, which was a form of technology. Progress is real. Man influences his control over the environment as time goes on and technology increases. The environment is still the master of man and other species. Idea: The trend is clear: our technology is allowing us to overpower our natural world. Imagine a time when we can control earthquakes or hurricanes or tornados. Or, when we went to the moon we figured out how to survive outside of the earth’s atmosphere. We somehow learned to transcend the boundaries of oxygen and spread our species to new places. Geography is the matrix of history. If you live on the coast, you will almost inevitably become an addict of the sea. You can smell the ocean for nearly anywhere in Great Britain. What happened? They took to the sea and became the finest naval seamen in history. We are controlled by everything around us and in us, but neither one of those two is the whole story. Everything was involved in what made us. Idea: we are the product of all of the previous events in history summed up and rolled into the present moment. However, even though everything is involved in what made us, there are a few forces that carry most of the weight. Those forces are genetics, culture, environment, and technology. The first biological lesson of history is that life is competition. Cooperation is real and it expands as technologies evolve, but mostly because it is a form of competition. We cooperate within our group, family, community, and nation in order to make our group more powerful. Cooperation is the ultimate form of competition. The second biological lesson of history is that life is selection. From nature’s standpoint, we are all born unfree and unequal. Nature loves difference because it is what allow selection to focus on the strong and eliminate the weak. Question: how many organisms get selected for? In a given population, what are the odds of a particular set of traits living on and how robust are those odds? What percentage of genes remain during this process? Freedom and equality are everlasting enemies. When one fails, the other dies. Only the man below the average desires equality. Those who are conscious of being above average desire freedom. In the end, superior ability has its way. The third biological lesson of history is that life must breed. Nature likes large litters and the struggle for survival that ends up selecting the strongest few. Every advance in agriculture and food production is eventually nullified by the increase in number of mouths to feed. Medicine and technology nullify natural selection by keeping the unfit alive. Much of what we call intelligence is the result of individual education, opportunity, and experience. The fertile inherit the earth. The birth rate may determine the fate of belief systems because the more people believe an idea and the more people are trained in an idea (usually the kids of believers), the more that idea will take hold. This has happened with religion throughout a lot of history, but perhaps now it is happening with science. All of the history of humankind is a short chapter in the history of biology. And all of biology is a short chapter in the history of the planet. And the planet is a short chapter in the history of the universe. History is the story of humankind in a struggle with other species and themselves for the limited resources and gifts of the environment. Competition is the basic law. Competition used to be among individuals. Then it was enlarged and it was among families. Then it was enlarged and it was among communities. And so on. The basic reality is competition. If you are not competing in life, what would you develop? A certain degree of competition is necessary not only for progress, but also for survival. Idea: Will competition ever be enlarged enough to not be between humans? We would need a stunning wild gamble where another species forces us to bond together and compete against a common foe. The child learns through their hands in early life. So perhaps standing on two feet was the method through which man became intelligent. Idea: It makes sense to me that intelligence and bipedal walking co-evolved. The role of accident was essential for the progress of humankind, but now, suddenly that is changing. Culture was the first way we began overpowering the role of accident. (Think the education system and teaching humans.) Technology is the second (and faster) way we are overpowering the role of accident in genetic evolution and the progress of humankind. Now you can be dealt a poor genetic hand (think learning disability) and our culture and our technology can still help you to survive. History is colorblind and can develop a civilization under any race and in nearly any circumstance. In the long run, differences between people yield to the environment. People like to think they are a little special. Without this bit of vanity, we might find it harder to push forward. In a way, delusion is a motivator. Human nature is the fundamental feelings and tendencies of humankind. By and large, the poor have the same impulses as the rich, but with less opportunity or skill to implement them. Social evolution is an interplay of custom with origination. The imitative majority follows the innovative minority. History is largely the battle of a few minorities, the winner of which is then lauded as the victor by the majority. Out of every 100 ideas, 99 will likely be inferior to the traditional alternative it was proposed to replace. No one person can become so well-informed in one lifetime to rethink and fully understand the customs and demands of the entire society. It is good for new ideas to be heard for the sake of the few that can be used. But it is also good for new ideas to be tested and questioned. Society is not founded on the ideals of humankind, but on the nature of humankind. We are a product of the forces and instincts that drive us. The basic lesson of history is that humans are essentially what they have been all throughout history. He changes his habits, but not his instincts. Over the course of history, human behavior has changed, but not human nature. The hero is just the product of a situation. Not the other way around. If it were not for the situation, we never would have heard of the hero. In a way, you could say mental toughness or heroism or other qualities of character are merely the outcome of what the situation demands. Morals are the way society exhorts behavior from its members. We can divide history into three stages: hunting, agriculture, and industry. It’s possible that things that are vices today were once virtues. Gradually, industry changed the structure of human culture and morality. People left the home and tribe to work in factories and live in cities, etc. History as it is usually lived is different from history as it is usually written. By definition, historians focus on the exceptional. Two examples of huge shifts in our cultural evolution: Copernicus and his discovery that we were but one planet is a vast ocean of planets and galaxies. Darwin and his discovery that we were just an animal that evolved from many other animals. These two beliefs radically changed how strongly we believed in religion. If we are but one of many planets, why would God care so much about us? If evolution is true, how could an intelligent designer have created us? Civilization itself is the most remarkable thing humankind has done. Civilization requires a delicate balance of social impulses with animal impulses. Durant defines civilization as social order that promotes cultural creation, so you need order and personal freedom / creative liberty. These appear to be at odds with one another, but it is often a tense, delicate balance between the two. If social order is too strong, freedom is restricted. If social order is too low, cooperation is not enabled to the degree to create civilization. You want to reign in your impulses and weaknesses to the point where they are useful, but not excessive. It is very dangerous for an individual to think that — even with 30 or 40 years of studying — he can judge and overcome the collective wisdom of the human race. Old ideas are very powerful. It is very possible that religion has enabled humans to collaborate all throughout history and make civilization possible. The goal of religion and morals and ethics and really any shared belief system is at least partially to overcome the impulses of our hunter-gatherer, reptilian brain. We try to overcome our animal instincts with social instincts. We are casting votes for a new identity that we hope will overpower the natural identity we have. One interesting take on why the decline of religion is quite bad: if religion is the shared belief that unifies a civilization and that belief system dies, then what will hold the civilization together? In every age, the forces of the individual seem to overpower the forces of the group. When all else fails, people will do what serves them best. They will do what ensures their survival. Idea: perhaps our natural wiring to ensure our own survival at all costs is why we are so moved by the act of sacrificing yourself for another. Think: Hodor in Game of Thrones. The word sin is relevant only in the sense of the individual violating the group. Reason cannot be the dominant aspect of any age because it is just an instrument. Reason and rationality are tools for thinking, but there are many other useful approaches that involve reason like sentiment. No one individual can ever hope to hold a candle to the insights of humanity as a whole. It is a fool's errand to think your ideas will be capable of battling such proven concepts. Without religion, it is very possible that the world would have been less moral. Yes, immorality and crime still persisted, but the forces of religion probably dampened their effects. As time wore on, philosophers became the driving forces behind societal changes rather than the church. And then, eventually science stole that job from philosophy. If history supports any religion it is probably dualism, which would explain the good things and bad things that occasionally happen through the lens of a good god and an evil god. The ultimate result of the industrial revolution was the replacement of religious entities with secular ones. Previously we thought laws were dictated by God. Now it is clear that they are dictated by fallible humans. One lesson of history is that religions have a way of reviving themselves. There is no example in history of a society maintaining moral life among the masses without religion as a force for binding people together. The function of religion is to give humankind a belief to be able to tolerate life. The individual instincts were hardwired into us by evolution. They are millions of years old. The social instincts are much younger and were learned over the last 70,000 years. Idea: In order for a group to let social instincts override the instincts of each individual, we need powerful beliefs and concepts. If we were just a horde of unconnected individuals we would never cooperate. This is where law and religion and capitalism come into play. They are ideas powerful enough to unite us despite our individual instincts. It seems arrogant to doubt tradition too much, too think that your supposedly brilliant mind could develop a better solution in 30 or 40 years than humankind has developed over thousands of years of working together. For this reason, it’s quite possible that we discount how useful and powerful religion can be. You should never trust an old man to be the judgment of youth because they would just cut off the bold things youth would do before they could do them. Idea: this boldness, in fact, is the only way that humankind advances. Most ideas we propose in our boldest moments are wrong. How could they not be? It’s not as if we are easily capable of thinking up something brilliant in our narrow window of time on earth. However, every now and then, the bold youth develops an idea that completely redefines the world and if we are to make progress, if we are to become better, we must be bold enough and delusional enough to believe that we can have those ideas. Idea: even Plato said that “a certain portion of the population” did not believe in God. So there were probably many proposals and creations that went against God. Many wild gambles that failed. But it was only after science was created that we had a wild gamble that proved worthy of the battle. Science deals largely with the external world. It has almost nothing to do with the internal world. What is consciousness? How can we answer this question with science? The men who can manage men manage the men who can manage only things and the men who can manage money manage all. Normally, men are judged by their ability to produce. Except in war, when they are ranked based on their ability to destroy. The concentration of wealth in a small portion of the population is a pattern that repeats itself throughout history. The most valuable talents and skills are confined to a few people, which means the most valuable wealth is confined to a few as well. This pattern shows up again and again. Liberty is possible when security has been achieved, but until that point you are facing competition. It is only because of competition that we developed the ability to create liberty. The first condition of freedom is limitation. If freedom is absolute, then it dies in chaos. The prime task of government is to establish order. The Pax Romana was perhaps the greatest achievement in the history of governance. If the majority of abilities are contained within a minority of men (that is, if a few people have more valuable skills than most others), then a minority rule is as inevitable as a disproportionate concentration of wealth. All consuming toil is usually the price of genius. The sanity of the individual lies in the continuity of his memories. The sanity of the group lies in the continuity of its traditions. Break away from either too fast and chaos follows. The only real revolution is in the enlightenment of the mind and the improvement of character. The only real emancipation is individual. The only real revolutionists are philosophers and saints. The excessive increase of anything causes a reaction in the opposite direction. Idea: this is a disturbing thought, but once culture and shared thought evolved, we suddenly developed the capacity to perform large swathes of “natural selection” on those who disagree with us. Imagine a revolt within a country where one group commits genocide on another group. These mass killings are largely ideological. In a sense, we could say that these killings are a form of “survival of the fittest”, but in this case it is the ideas that the ruling group deems fit rather than physical fitness. Suddenly, ideology becomes a form of natural selection and because we are the ones with the ideas, we are now the force that selects them. If you take this line of thinking far enough, you get to some dangerous territory. Who decides which ideas are fit? You can’t fool all of the people all the time, but you can fool enough of them to rule a large country. Democracy has done less harm and more good than any other form of government. The goal of democracy is not to make every man equal, but to make his access to opportunity more equal. The ideal is not to raise every man to power, but to give him access to each point of entry where his fitness and skill can be tested. In other words, the hope of democracy is to offer a level playing field to start and to let your talents carry you where they may. At what point does liberty become excessive? At what point does it become disorder? Civilization is made possible by self-restraint. It is clear that freedom is made possible by boundaries of some sort. If we cross those boundaries, we have chaos not civilization. You cannot have freedom without order. War seems to be a constant among all civilizations and times. It is a result of competition among groups just as individuals compete as well. War is, paradoxically, the driver of much technological change and cultural change that leads to long periods of peace afterward. We repeatedly enlarge our instruments without enlarging our purpose. We have developed more complex ways to pursue basic human needs. We can define progress as the increasing control of the environment by life. If education is the measure of progress then we have progressed more than ever before. Education is the transmission of as much of human heritage and learning as we can fully achieve. If progress is real, it is not because we are any richer or wiser than those of the past, but because we are born at a higher level and further up the pedestal of our heritage. We are born with the fruits of a larger portion of human heritage. Do not feel depressed that life may only have meaning insofar as man puts into it. It is remarkable that we can put any meaning into life at all. The thing that is rare is the capability to even invent meaning for ourselves, for such a task appears impossible for all other animals. Do not be an optimist or a pessimist. Instead, be a realist. Accept that life is composed of difficulties and delights. The difficulties are a natural price of existence. The delights are goodies you don’t necessarily deserve. It is hard to get a sense of the quality of one’s own age. We usually know more about a previous age’s achievements than their faults. Meanwhile, we usually know more about our faults and downplay our achievements. This makes comparison between ages difficult. Human nature changes, but it changes at an incredibly slow, geological pace. We can say with reasonable certainty that human nature has been virtually unchanged in the last 2,000 years and quite possibly far longer than that. Human nature is strongly linked to biology. These are the intrinsic traits that we have and they change very slowly through evolution. Progress is an improvement in the means that we use for achieving the same old ends. It’s possible that our progress is only of means and not of ends. Do we merely achieve the same desires of 10,000 years ago, but through new, modern means. Human nature is uncivilized. It is almost contra-civilization. It is only through culture and restraint and morality that we acquire civilized activities. The technique of disseminating heritage and absorbing it has grown incredibly over time. Culture is developing a tighter strangle hold on our behavior than ever before. One way to explain this is to say that there is far more to learn and inherit than there was even 100 years ago. The wealth of human knowledge increases with each passing year and endows a slightly greater advantage to those born today than those born yesterday. “Consider education not as a painful accumulation of facts and dates and reigns, nor merely the necessary preparation of the individual to earn his keep in the world, but as a transmission of our mental, moral, technical, and aesthetic heritage. As fully as possible to as many as possible for the embellishment of man’s understanding, control, and enjoyment of life. The heritage that we can now more fully transmit is richer than ever before. It is richer than that of Pericles, for it includes the Greek following that followed him. Richer than Leonardo’s for it includes him and the Italian renaissance. Richer than Voltaire for it embraces all the French enlightenment and its ecumenical dissemination.” -Will Durant “If progress is real despite our whining, it is not because we are born any healthier, better, or wiser than infants were in the past, but because we are born to a richer heritage, born on a higher level of that pedestal which the accumulation of knowledge and art raises as the ground and support of our being. The heritage rises, and man rises in proportion as he receives it.” -Will Durant “History is philosophy teaching by examples.” -Henry St. John Revolutions are just surface level changes. Human nature remains the same. The people merely change with the revolution and fall back into the same underlying patterns. Every generation rebels against the preceding one. In many ways, it is natural and desirable. When everybody owns everything, nobody takes care of anything. You cannot make men equal by passing laws. Economic history is the slow heartbeat of the social organism. No matter who is in power, the gains gradually accrue to the most clever and talented. Then, eventually, there is some fracturing of the order, a new minority rises to power, and the pattern repeats itself. Most of the poor are victims of racial discrimination and environmental handicaps. Every life, every society, and every species is an experiment. It all ends in death eventually. Every religion should preach morality, not theology. Persons under 30 should never trust the economic, political, and moral ideas of other persons under 30. Let our sons and daughters be punished when they break the law, but let us believe in them when they open their hearts. Ideas are the strongest things of all in history. Even a gun was originally an idea. In old age, you understand how good it is that there should be radicals and how good it is that there should be conservatives. The radicals supply the gas and the conservatives apply the brakes. Both of those functions are indispensable. That tension is required for a functioning society."
Manual for Living by Epictetus,"Some things are in your power and some are not—do not confuse the two and do not desire the things that are not in your power. It is our opinion of things that determines how we feel about a particular event, not the event itself. Think carefully about how you spend your life because people often spend their lives chasing things that are neither as desirable nor as important as they seem.","Some things are in our power and some are not. Examples of things not in our power: reputation, power, and the things that are not our own acts. Remember, if you think the things that are in the power of others are in your own power, then you will be hindered, frustrated, and annoyed. If you desire to do great things, then remember that you must give things your full attention — not just a mild effort — and leave many other things alone for the time being. Before setting your sights on a goal make sure that said goal is within your power — that is, that it is something you actually have control over — and if it is not within your power, do not let it concern you. Do not be averted to the things not within your power — illness, death, disease, etc. — if you desire anything not within your power, the result will be unfortunate. “It is the act of an ill-instructed man to blame others for his own bad condition.” Your opinion of things is what makes them good or bad. You are responsible for your own opinions, thoughts, and feelings. Most challenges are an impediment to a particular thing, but not to your will or to you as a person. “Going lame is an impediment to your leg, but not to your will.” If you get the raw end of a business deal or if someone steals from you or if some small misfortune befalls you — don’t fret over it. Such is the price of living in tranquility and not allowing every small setback to ruin your life. It is much better to live this way than to try and squeeze every ounce out of each opportunity for you to get more or get what you are owed. If you seem to be a person of importance to some people, ignore them. Realize you know nothing. If you accept that you are a person of importance, it becomes harder to learn. Accept the things that come to you — wealth, power, food, relationships, etc. — with grace and dignity, but do not desire them before they get to you. When someone responds negatively to an event — like crying when their child goes off to college — offer them sympathy and support, but notice that this event does not effect others. The stranger on the corner does not weep. Thus, it is not the event that is negative, but the person’s opinion of it. Although you may offer outward sympathy and support, do not let such events effect you internally. I disagree with Epictetus’ point about “we are all actors and your job is to play the role you’ve been given.” I get that he is making an attempt at saying, “Don’t try to be someone you’re not,” but I think the language could have been better. His phrasing makes it sound like, “You have no control over your life. If you’re poor, you’re poor. Get over it, accept it, and be happy being poor.” In some ways, useful. In other ways, too much of a fixed mindset for my taste. I prefer a more empowering view of your life and the control you have over it. Each day, keep in mind that death can be close to you. You will not take your time for granted. “Which would you rather have? Money or a faithful and modest friend?” “Observe both the things that come first and the things that follow.” You can’t just look at someone competing on the Olympic stage and desire that. You must also look at the practice, the effort, the time, and the sacrifice that came before the result. If you consider all of what is required for a task and then still wish to do it … only then should you proceed because you will properly understand what is required. “If a man has reported to you that a certain person speaks ill of you do not make any defense to what has been told you, but reply, “The man did not know the rest of my faults for he would not have mentioned these only.” Do not complain of all the bad things that have happened to you. It is not of interest to others. If you are doing something that you believe is right do not worry about people who will criticize it wrongly. Whoa! Chapter 40 is an ancient shout out to female empowerment and equality. “It is worthwhile to let [women] know that they are valued by men.” “You are neither possession nor speech.” If you have more money, then you’re just richer than someone not better than them. If you are more eloquent than someone, then you are just better spoken not a better person."

","Successful investing requires thoughtful attention to many separate aspects, all at the same time. Omit any one and the result is likely to be less than satisfactory. You have to follow a disciplined thought process in order to be successful, but it doesn’t have to be mine. “Experience is what you got when you didn’t get what you wanted.” Good times teach only bad lessons: that investing is easy, that you know its secrets, and that you needn’t worry about risk. No idea can be any better than the action taken on it. Second-level thinking is deep, complex and convoluted. The second-level thinker takes a great many things into account: • What is the range of likely future outcomes? • Which outcome do I think will occur? • What’s the probability I’m right? • What does the consensus think? • How does my expectation differ from the consensus? • How does the current price for the asset comport with the consensus view of the future, and with mine? • Is the consensus psychology that’s incorporated in the price too bullish or bearish? • What will happen to the asset’s price if the consensus turns out to be right, and what if I’m right? First-level thinkers look for simple formulas and easy answers. Second-level thinkers know that success in investing is the antithesis of simple Extraordinary performance comes only from correct nonconsensus forecasts, but nonconsensus forecasts are hard to make, hard to make correctly and hard to act on. You can’t do the same things others do and expect to outperform. If your behavior is conventional, you’re likely to get conventional results—either good or bad. In theory there’s no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is. YOGI BERRA To beat the market you must hold an idiosyncratic, or nonconsensus, view. CHRISTOPHER DAVIS: It is also critical to spend time trying to fully understand the incentives at work in any given situation. Flawed incentives can often explain irrational, destructive, or counterintuitive behaviors or outcomes. Most people are driven by greed, fear, envy and other emotions that render objectivity impossible and open the door for significant mistakes. SETH KLARMAN: Silos are a double-edged sword. A narrow focus leads to potentially superior knowledge. But concentration of effort within rigid boundaries leaves a strong possibility of mispricings outside those borders. Also, if others’ silos are similar to your own, competitive forces will likely drive down returns in spite of superior knowledge within such silos. The image here is of the efficient-market-believing finance professor who takes a walk with a student. “Isn’t that a $10 bill lying on the ground?” asks the student. “No, it can’t be a $10 bill,” answers the professor. “If it were, someone would have picked it up by now.” The professor walks away, and the student picks it up and has a beer. “Being too far ahead of your time is indistinguishable from being wrong.” People should like something less when its price rises, but in investing they often like it more. The positives behind stocks can be genuine and still produce losses if you overpay for them. Buying something for less than its value. In my opinion, this is what it’s all about—the most dependable way to make money. Buying at a discount from intrinsic value and having the asset’s price move toward its value doesn’t require serendipity; it just requires that market participants wake up to reality. When the market’s functioning properly, value exerts a magnetic pull on price. Of all the possible routes to investment profit, buying cheap is clearly the most reliable. The most dangerous investment conditions generally stem from psychology that’s too positive. Investors who want some objective measure of risk-adjusted return—and they are many—can only look to the so-called Sharpe ratio. “There’s a big difference between probability and outcome. Probable things fail to happen—and improbable things happen—all the time.” Quantification often lends excessive authority to statements that should be taken with a grain of salt. Many futures are possible, to paraphrase Dimson, but only one future occurs. People usually expect the future to be like the past and underestimate the potential for change. We hear a lot about “worst-case” projections, but they often turn out not to be negative enough. I tell my father’s story of the gambler who lost regularly. One day he heard about a race with only one horse in it, so he bet the rent money. Halfway around the track, the horse jumped over the fence and ran away. Invariably things can get worse than people expect. Risk means uncertainty about which outcome will occur and about the possibility of loss when the unfavorable ones do. High risk, in other words, comes primarily with high prices. The greatest risk doesn’t come from low quality or high volatility. It comes from paying prices that are too high. There are few things as risky as the widespread belief that there’s no risk. I’m firmly convinced that investment risk resides most where it is least perceived. Most investors think quality, as opposed to price, is the determinant of whether something’s risky. High quality assets can be risky, and low quality assets can be safe. Quite often “high-quality” companies sell for high prices, making them poor investments. Over a full career, most investors’ results will be determined more by how many losers they have, and how bad they are, than by the greatness of their winners. JOEL GREENBLATT: The math behind the compounding of negative returns helps ensure this outcome (e.g., a 40 percent loss in one year requires a return of 67 percent to fully recover). There is a right time to argue that things will be better, and that’s when the market is on its backside and everyone else is selling things at giveaway prices. When things are going well and prices are high, investors rush to buy, forgetting all prudence. Then, when there’s chaos all around and assets are on the bargain counter, they lose all willingness to bear risk and rush to sell. Stocks are cheapest when everything looks grim. “What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.” Busts are the product of booms, and I’m convinced it’s usually more correct to attribute a bust to the excesses of the preceding boom than to the specific event that sets off the correction. Demosthenes: “Nothing is easier than self-deceit. For what each man wishes, that he also believes to be true.” People who might be perfectly happy with their lot in isolation become miserable when they see others do better. High returns can be unsatisfying if others do better, while low returns are often enough if others do worse. Bubbles are capable of arising on their own and need not be preceded by crashes, whereas crashes are invariably preceded by bubbles. Market excesses are ultimately punished, not rewarded. Superior investing, as I hope I’ve convinced you by now, requires second-level thinking—a way of thinking that’s different from that of others, more complex and more insightful. Certainly the markets, and investor attitudes and behavior, spend only a small portion of the time at “the happy medium.” “Once-in-a-lifetime” market extremes seem to occur once every decade or so—not often enough for an investor to build a career around capitalizing on them. But attempting to do so should be an important component of any investor’s approach. In the long run, the market gets it right. But you have to survive over the short run, to get to the long run. SETH KLARMAN: This is where it is particularly important to remember the teachings of Graham and Dodd. If you look to the markets for a report card, owning a stock that declines every day will make you feel like a failure. But if you remember that you own a fractional interest in a business and that every day you are able to buy in at a greater discount to underlying value, you might just be able to maintain a cheerful disposition. This is exactly how Warren Buffett describes bargain hunting amid the ravages of the 1973 to 1974 bear market. Most people seem to think outstanding performance to date presages outstanding future performance. Actually, it’s more likely that outstanding performance to date has borrowed from the future and thus presages subpar performance from here on out. In dealing with the future, we must think about two things: (a) what might happen and (b) the probability that it will happen. The herd applies optimism at the top and pessimism at the bottom. Thus, to benefit, we must be skeptical of the optimism that thrives at the top, and skeptical of the pessimism that prevails at the bottom. The best opportunities are usually found among things most others won’t do. The raw materials for the process consist of (a) a list of potential investments, (b) estimates of their intrinsic value, (c) a sense for how their prices compare with their intrinsic value, and (d) an understanding of the risks involved in each, and of the effect their inclusion would have on the portfolio being assembled. There aren’t always great things to do, and sometimes we maximize our contribution by being discerning and relatively inactive. Patient opportunism—waiting for bargains—is often your best strategy. You’ll do better if you wait for investments to come to you rather than go chasing after them. You tend to get better buys if you select from the list of things sellers are motivated to sell rather than start with a fixed notion as to what you want to own. An opportunist buys things because they’re offered at bargain prices. There’s nothing special about buying when prices aren’t low. JOEL GREENBLATT: This is one of the hardest things to master for professional investors: coming in each day for work and doing nothing. Professional investors: coming in each day for work and doing nothing. What’s past is past and can’t be undone. It has led to the circumstances we now face. All we can do is recognize our circumstances for what they are and make the best decisions we can, given the givens. One of the great things about investing is that the only real penalty is for making losing investments. There’s no penalty for omitting losing investments, of course, just rewards. And even for missing a few winners, the penalty is bearable. Missing a profitable opportunity is of less significance than investing in a loser. You simply cannot create investment opportunities when they’re not there. The dumbest thing you can do is to insist on perpetuating high returns—and give back your profits in the process. If it’s not there, hoping won’t make it so. When prices are high, it’s inescapable that prospective returns are low (and risks are high). We have two classes of forecasters: Those who don’t know—and those who don’t know they don’t know. JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH It’s frightening to think that you might not know something, but more frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who have faith that they know exactly what’s going on. AMOS TVERSKY The more we concentrate on smaller-picture things, the more it’s possible to gain a knowledge advantage. Whatever limitations are imposed on us in the investment world, it’s a heck of a lot better to acknowledge them and accommodate than to deny them and forge ahead. In the world of investing, … nothing is as dependable as cycles. Fundamentals, psychology, prices and returns will rise and fall, presenting opportunities to make mistakes or to profit from the mistakes of others. They are the givens. We may never know where we’re going, but we’d better have a good idea where we are. The truth is, much in investing is ruled by luck. SETH KLARMAN: This is why it is all-important to look not at investors’ track records but at what they are doing to achieve those records. Does it make sense? Does it appear replicable? Why haven’t competitive forces priced away any apparent market inefficiencies that enabled this investment success? The correctness of a decision can’t be judged from the outcome. Nevertheless, that’s how people assess it. A good decision is one that’s optimal at the time it’s made, when the future is by definition unknown. Thus, correct decisions are often unsuccessful, and vice versa. Randomness alone can produce just about any outcome in the short run. The things that happened are only a small subset of the things that could have happened. Thus, the fact that a stratagem or action worked—under the circumstances that unfolded—doesn’t necessarily prove the decision behind it was wise. A good decision is one that a logical, intelligent and informed person would have made under the circumstances as they appeared at the time, before the outcome was known. One year with a great return can overstate the manager’s skill and obscure the risk he or she took. Yet people are surprised when that great year is followed by a terrible year. Investors invariably lose track of the fact that both short-term gains and short-term losses can be impostors, and of the importance of digging deep to understand what underlies them. Investment performance is what happens to a portfolio when events unfold. Professional tennis is a “winner’s game,” in which the match goes to the player who’s able to hit the most winners: fast-paced, well-placed shots that an opponent can’t return. But the tennis the rest of us play is a “loser’s game,” with the match going to the player who hits the fewest losers. The winner just keeps the ball in play until the loser hits it into the net or off the court. In other words, in amateur tennis, points aren’t won; they’re lost. So much is within the control of professional tennis players that they really should go for winners. And they’d better, since if they serve up easy balls, their opponents will hit winners of their own and take points. In contrast, investment results are only partly within the investors’ control, and investors can make good money—and outlast their opponents—without trying tough shots. Oaktree portfolios are set up to outperform in bad times, and that’s when we think outperformance is essential. “Because ensuring the ability to survive under adverse circumstances is incompatible with maximizing returns in the good times, investors must choose between the two.” If you minimize the chance of loss in an investment, most of the other alternatives are good. One of the most striking things I’ve noted over the last thirty-five years is how brief most outstanding investment careers are. We believe firmly that “if we avoid the losers, the winners will take care of themselves.” The more challenging and potentially lucrative the waters you fish in, the more likely they are to have attracted skilled fishermen. The cautious seldom err or write great poetry. Caution can help us avoid mistakes, but it can also keep us from great accomplishments. Worry about the possibility of loss. Worry that there’s something you don’t know. Worry that you can make high-quality decisions but still be hit by bad luck or surprise events. An investor needs do very few things right as long as he avoids big mistakes. WARREN BUFFETT A portfolio that contains too little risk can make you underperform in a bull market, but no one ever went bust from that; there are far worse fates. The success of your investment actions shouldn’t be highly dependent on normal outcomes prevailing; instead, you must allow for outliers. The financial crisis occurred largely because never-before-seen events collided with risky, levered structures that weren’t engineered to withstand them. It’s worth noting that the assumption that something can’t happen has the potential to make it happen, since people who believe it can’t happen will engage in risky behavior and thus alter the environment. Understanding and anticipating the power of correlation—and thus the limitations of diversification—is a principal aspect of risk control and portfolio management, but it’s very hard to accomplish. The failure to correctly anticipate co-movement within a portfolio is a critical source of investment error. If the desire to make money causes you to buy even though price is too high, in the hope that the asset will continue appreciating or the tactic will keep working, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment. The essential first step in avoiding pitfalls consists of being on the lookout for them. Leverage magnifies outcomes but doesn’t add value. It can make great sense to use leverage to increase your investment in assets at bargain prices offering high promised returns or generous risk premiums. But it can be dangerous to use leverage to buy more of assets that offer low returns or narrow risk spreads—in other words, assets that are fully priced or overpriced. It makes little sense to use leverage to try to turn inadequate returns into adequate returns. One way to improve investment results—which we try hard to apply at Oaktree—is to think about what “today’s mistake” might be and try to avoid it. When there’s nothing particularly clever to do, the potential pitfall lies in insisting on being clever."
Mastery by George Leonard,"The most successful path to mastering anything is to practice for the sake of the practice itself, not for the result. All significant learning is composed of brief spurts of progress followed by long periods of work where if feels as if you are stuck on a plateau. There are no experts–only learners.","Definition of mastery: the mysterious process during which what is at first difficult becomes progressively easier and more pleasurable through practice. If there is any sure route to success and fulfillment in life, it is to be found in the long-term, essentially goalless process of mastery. Start with something simple. All significant learning is composed of brief spurts of progress followed by long periods of work where if feels as if you’re going nowhere. The seven varieties of intelligence: linguistic, musical, logical/mathematical, spatial, bodily/kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal. The one physical feat where humans would outperform nearly all other animals of equal (or even larger) size is endurance running. On the path to improvement: the general progression is always the same. To take the master’s journey, you have to practice diligently, striving to hone your skills, to attain new levels of competence. But while doing so, you also have to be willing to spend most of your time on a plateau, to keep practicing even hen you seem to be getting nowhere. As we practice things, even though it feels like we are making no progress at all, we are turning new behaviors into habits. Learning is happening all along. The most successful path to mastery is to practice for the sake of the practice itself. Not for the result. On mastery in relationships: In today’s world two partners are rarely willing to live indefinitely on an unchanging plateau. When your tennis partner starts improving his or her game and you don’t, the game eventually breaks up. The same thing applies to relationships. Every time we spend money, we make an indication about what we value. The anti-mastery mentality is focused on quick fixes. Heart surgery rather than diet and exercise. Lottery tickets rather than retirement savings. In business, some people can make a lot of money in a short amount of time (corporate raiders, finance whiz kids, tech startups), but often there is very little value created for others or the national economy. The individual gets rich, but the world doesn’t get much better. Is this really a better path than the one of the craftsman? Someone who slowly and methodically improves, contributes something useful and valuable to society, and makes enough money in the process (despite not getting rich)? In the long run, the war against mastery, the path to patient, dedicated effort without attachment to immediate results, is a war that can’t be won. On human nature: Man is a learning animal, and the essence of the species is encoded in that simple term. The mastery of skills that are not genetically programmed is the most characteristically human of all activities. The five keys to mastery: Instruction, Practice, Surrender, Intentionality, and The Edge. On learning: For mastering most skills, there’s nothing better than being in the hands of a master teacher. On finding a good teacher: To see the teacher clearly, look at his students. The best teachers strive to point out what a student is doing right just as frequently as what they are doing wrong. The idea of a teacher rarely giving praise and teaching through strict criticism is a myth. One benefit of learning slowly: it forces you to look deeply at the process and you discover incremental steps that you might otherwise gloss over if progress came easily. Idea: pursuing the path to mastery requires a certain type of mindset and willingness to work. This is likely influenced by genetics just as our physical abilities are influenced by genetics. People often say something to the effect of, “I’ve seen so many talented athletes with God-given ability who just didn’t want to work hard. They faded away.” These statements are overlooking the fact that psychological abilities are largely fixed too. The odds that someone has the peak physical abilities (“God-given talent”) AND the peak mental abilities (willingness to work hard) are incredibly low. Thus, you would expect the people to perform the best who are very high on mental abilities and high enough on physical abilities. Regardless of your genetic potential, you have to work just as hard to fulfill it. Potential is just opportunity. The best teachers are the ones who have discovered how to involve each student actively in the process of learning. Practice is often used as a description of what we do. Instead, we can look at practice as something we have, something we are defined by. Rewards will always come to someone who commits to the practice, but the rewards are not the goal. The practice is the goal. Mastery reveals so much more to learn as you continue the journey. The destination is two miles farther away for every mile we travel. Masters love the practice and because they love it, they get better. And the better they get, the more they enjoy the practice. It’s an upward spiral. The master of any game is generally the master of practice as well. Good idea: having dinner with the family each night is a form of practice, one that you can commit to just as passionately as practicing your craft. “How long will it take me to master Aikido?” a prospective student asks. “How long do you expect to live?” is the only respectable response. Mastery is practice. Mastery is staying on the path. The essence of boredom is to be found in the obsessive search for novelty. Satisfaction lies in mindful repetition, the discovery of endless richness as subtle variations on familiar themes. There are no experts. There are only learners. On how things live on in our minds even after they are physically gone: “More and more, the universe looks like a great thought rather than a great machine.” -Sir James Jeans Every master visualizes their success. Now we come, as come we must in anything of real consequence, to a seeming contradiction, a paradox. Almost without exception, those who are masters are dedicated to the fundamentals of their calling. At the same time, they are the ones most likely to challenge their previous limits. Ancient Eastern wisdom: “Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood and carry water.” Backsliding is a universal experience. Everyone resists a significant change whether it is for worse or for better. Homeostasis: Our body, brain, and behavior have a built in tendency to stay within very narrow limits. Homeostasis works to keep things as they are even if they aren’t very good. Resistance is proportionate to the size and speed of the change, not to whether the change is a favorable or unfavorable one. When you realize more of your potential in any endeavor (even a small one), it can change the rest of you in many ways. The alarm bells that ring when you try something new (fear, sweat, higher heart rate, discomfort) are signals of growth. It’s important not to ignore them for safety reasons, but you can also look at them as a sign of your improvement. Follow a practice. People embarking on any form of change will gain stability and comfort though practicing something daily. The practice provides a stable base during the instability of change. To learn is to change. Dedicate yourself to lifelong learning. A human being is the kind of machine that wears out from lack of use. There are limits, but for the most part we gain energy by using energy. Maintain physical fitness. It contributes enormous energy to our lives. Acknowledge the negative and accentuate the positive. Denial inhibits energy while realistic acknowledgment of the truth releases it. To move in one direction, you must forgo all others. To pursue one goal is to forsake a very large number of other possible goals. Avoid injury. Most people get injured because of goal obsessiveness. Pay attention to the signals your body gives and negotiate with them—but don’t override them or ignore them. To be deadly serious is to suffer tunnel vision. Humor not only lightens your load, it broadens your vision. Cool example of ritual: some surgeons wash their hands and put on their gowns in the same fashion before each surgery. It’s the pattern and ritual of it that sets their mind in the right place for performance. Mastery is not about perfection. It’s about the process. It’s truly bizarre when you think about it that we will devote ourselves fully to developing our tennis game, but leave something like our relationships largely to chance. The plateaus, the ups, and the downs are even greater in our relationships than in other areas of life. And you will discover that your greatest learning happens on the plateaus. To be psychologically balanced and centered depends heavily on being physically balanced and centered. The best way to describe your total creative capacity is to say that for all practical purposes it is infinite. Jigoro Kano, the founder of Judo, asked to be buried in his white belt after death. What an awesome symbol: the ultimate master forever embracing the mark of a beginner. If you want to truly master something, you must be willing to remain a beginner and look a fool. The beginner’s mind is required for learning anything new."
Rules for a Knight by Ethan Hawke,"This book contains a number of “rules for a knight,” which are lessons on how to live better. For example, 1) never announce that you are a knight, simply behave as one and 2) the only intelligent response to the ongoing gift of life is gratitude, and 3) how a knight lives is what is important, not on which particular afternoon he was born or on which specific morning he might die. Along with many other insights.","If I return safely home from tomorrow’s battle, all the better; but should I not, then turn to these pages whenever you might look for my voice in guidance. I do not want you children to use my untimely death, or any setback that life may deliver, as an excuse not to take responsibility for yourselves. I decided to seek out the wisest man I could find and ask him to tell me how to live. Am I weak or am I strong? Am I kind or cruel? I have been all these things! I don’t even truly understand the difference between right and wrong. Just and unjust. And what does any of it matter, since in no time at all everybody I know will be rotting in the ground feeding worms?” The first thing you must understand is that you need not have gone anywhere. You are always in the right place at exactly the right time, and you always have been.” Create time alone with yourself. When seeking the wisdom and clarity of your own mind, silence is a helpful tool. The voice of our spirit is gentle and cannot be heard when it has to compete with others. Just as it is impossible to see your reflection in troubled water, so too is it with the soul. He said, “While I teach you about the ways of war, I want you to know that the real struggle is between the two wolves that live inside each of us.” “Two wolves?” I asked, seated on an old log near the fire. My eyes were transfixed by the flames twisting uncomfortably in the night air. “One wolf is evil,” he continued. “It is anger, envy, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, deceit, false pride.” He paused, poking the embers of our fire with a long stick he’d been carving. “The other is good. It is joy, love, hope, serenity, humility, loving-kindness, forgiveness, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, faith.” I considered that for a minute, then tentatively asked, “Which wolf will win?” Sparks danced towards the stars as the old man stared into the glare of the flames and replied: “Whichever one you feed.” Never announce that you are a knight, simply behave as one. You are better than no one, and no one is better than you. All living things rely on each other. If there were no earthworms, the soil would be depleted, grow no food, and we would die. Understanding that he relies on all that surrounds him, a knight is kind above all. He knows he will need many friends. Proper manners are not trivial. Being polite is part of our daily meditation on the equality of mankind. Humility is the ability to see yourself in the context of a much larger world. “Be humble or get humbled,” Grandfather would say. “A knight is never so arrogant as to think he has nothing left to learn.” “Expect nothing, and you will enjoy everything!” The only intelligent response to the ongoing gift of life is gratitude. The simple joys are the great ones. Pleasure is not complicated. Never pretend you are not a knight or attempt to diminish yourself because you deem it will make others more comfortable. We show others the most respect by offering the best of ourselves. We all see the world through the prism of our identity. A knight is the best kind of servant, leaving every space he enters brighter and cleaner than when he arrived. His surroundings reflect his state of mind. “Shoot for nothing. When an archer shoots for a prize, he gets tight.” “When you shoot to impress, your eyes divide. You see two targets,” We must live and work together as brothers or perish together as fools. I learned that evening that rain falls equally on all things. There are only two possible outcomes whenever you compare yourself to another, vanity or bitterness, and both are without value. The quality of your life will, to a large extent, be decided by with whom you elect to spend your time. Remember, a friend does not need you to impress him. A friend loves you because you are true to yourself, not because you agree with him. Beware of grand gestures; the real mettle of friendship is forged in life’s daily workings. It’s difficult to explain, but in some ways it can be easy to be supportive when your friend is hurt or sad. You may find it is more challenging to be wholeheartedly supportive when extreme good fortune befalls a friend and not you. Those who cannot easily forgive will not collect many friends. Look for the best in others and yourself. Every great knight has weaknesses. You will be no different. Like a dead branch falling from a tree, which then decomposes and nourishes the soil, your disappointments can transform into the elements of change and growth. We do not need a “perfect” family or the “ideal” community. The one we have is good enough with which to begin our work. To head north, a knight may use the North Star to guide him, but he will not arrive at the North Star. A knight’s duty is only to proceed in that direction. Don’t fear suffering. The strongest steel is forged in the hottest fire. Without a little agony, none of us would bother to learn a thing. Anything that gives light must endure burning. Courage is our ability and willingness to overcome our fear. Horsemanship—virtually every task I can think of is aided by an awareness of breath. It is the connective tissue of the universe, binding all living creatures together. By focusing on our breath, we are able to more adeptly inhabit our bodies and function on instinct. Every task I can think of is aided by an awareness of breath. It is the connective tissue of the universe, binding all living creatures together. By focusing on our breath, we are able to more adeptly inhabit our bodies and function on instinct. Pay attention: what you need to know is usually in front of you. There are no secrets, just things people choose not to notice. Later he told me when he was younger he learned the secret to performing under pressure: don’t do it for yourself. Do it for someone else. “I know your grandfather always tells us to think of nothing. But when I get scared I just think of someone I love.” Grace is the ability to accept change. Be open and supple; the brittle break. Habit, routine, and too much consistency numb our minds and pave the road for us to sleepwalk through our lives. But to live well, sometimes you will need to hold two seemingly opposing truths, one in each hand, and carry them both comfortably. Nature creates its balance with opposites. We need the sun and the rain, the glacier and the desert. Young people, women and men, often use the possession of beauty or wealth as permission to be uninteresting, undisciplined, and ill-informed. As you grow into maturity, do not concern yourself with aging. A rose is striking in full bloom only because it will never be so again, but a budding rose is also stunning, as are the dark petals of autumn. As you grow into maturity, do not concern yourself with aging. A rose is striking in full bloom only because it will never be so again, but a budding rose is also stunning, as are the dark petals of autumn. It is the fact that time is passing that creates its preciousness. There is no such thing as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. There is a moment for action, and with a clear mind that moment is obvious. There is only one thing for which a knight has no patience: injustice. Every true knight fights for human dignity at all times. A knight sets out to illuminate the darkness in society, not from its leaves but from its roots. This is how justice will be realized. Find the source. You were born owning nothing and with nothing you will pass out of this life. Be frugal and you can be generous. There have always been two ways to be rich: by accumulating vast sums or by needing very little. The peregrine falcon is the swiftest, most adept animal I have ever seen. It is worth noting that, like many birds, the falcon’s bones are hollow. Travel light. “A hearty laugh is the telltale sign of good health.” “Sometimes I think that the more wealth people accumulate, the less they laugh.” “I am happy where I am,” he confided to me. “I have friends. I’m good at what I do. And that is enough.” In the field of battle, as in all things, you will perform as you practice; so practice hard. The better a knight prepares, the less willing he will be to surrender. Oddly, with discipline, structure, and order, you will find there is freedom. Often we imagine that we will work hard until we arrive at some distant goal, and then we will be happy. This is a delusion. Happiness is the result of a life lived with purpose. Happiness is not an objective. Seek pleasure and you will quickly discover the shortest path to suffering. Your life is your responsibility, and you always have the choice to do your best. Do not be overconcerned with avoiding pain or seeking pleasure. If you are concentrating on the results of your actions, you are not dedicated to your task. You are not fragile. Engage. “There are only two things worth hating: an easy life and too much success.” Ordinary effort, ordinary result. Everyone wants to be a knight; wanting is no great accomplishment. You must not wait for the inevitable storms of life before you ready your mind. Thought precedes action. How we handle times of peace and calm will determine our behavior in moments of crisis. Do not speak ill of others. A knight does not spread news that he does not know to be certain, or condemn things that he does not understand. Disparaging yourself in order to rouse compassion in others is not humility. A knight does not whine. He concerns himself with affecting change, not burdening the world with his grievances. Never make a big decision without first walking a mile. In matters of great importance, trust your own gut. Don’t be fooled, and don’t be hurried. There is plenty of time to make mistakes. Every knight holds human equality as an unwavering truth. A knight is never present when men or women are being degraded or compromised in any way, because if a knight were present, those committing the hurtful acts or words would be made to stop. Love is the end goal. It is the music of our lives. There is no obstacle that enough love cannot move. Confrontation is always preferable to dishonesty, or injustice. Do the good you have the power to do. Life is a long series of farewells; only the circumstances should surprise us. How a knight lives is what is important, not on which particular afternoon he was born or on which specific morning he might die. One thing he had learned in his long life was that if he understood something, things were just as they were, and if he did not understand something, things were still simply just as they were."

","Investors are frequently lured by the prospect of quick and easy gain and fall victim to the many fads of Wall Street. Value investing, the strategy of investing in securities trading at an appreciable discount from underlying value, has a long history of delivering excellent investment results with very limited downside risk. It is easy to stray but a continuous effort to remain disciplined. Avoiding where others go wrong is an important step in achieving investment success. In fact, it almost ensures it. Value investing requires a great deal of hard work, unusually strict discipline, and a long-term investment horizon. It is necessary instead to understand the rationale behind the rules in order to appreciate why they work when they do and don’t when they don’t. The correct choice for investors is obvious but requires a level of commitment most are unwilling to make. Most investors are primarily oriented toward return, how much they can make, and pay little attention to risk, how much they can lose. A margin of safety is necessary because valuation is an imprecise art, the future is unpredictable, and investors are human and do make mistakes. Value investors invest with a margin of safety that protects them from large losses in declining markets. once you adopt a value-investment strategy, any other investment behavior starts to seem like gambling. To investors stocks represent fractional ownership of underlying businesses and bonds are loans to those businesses. In reality, no one knows what the market will do; trying to predict it is a waste of time, and investing based upon that prediction is a speculative undertaking. There is comfort in consensus; those in the majority gain confidence from their very number. (Note: This is a great way to think about why we go along with the crowd, “the comfort of consensus.”) But there is one critical difference: investments throw off cash flow for the benefit of the owners; speculations do not.4 The return to the owners of speculations depends exclusively on the vagaries of the resale market. Stocks and bonds go up and down in price, as do Monets and Mickey Mantle rookie cards, but there should be no confusion as to which are the true investments Investments, even very long-term investments like newly planted timber properties, will eventually throw off cash flow. A machine makes widgets that are marketed, a building is occupied by tenants who pay rent, and trees on a timber property are eventually harvested and sold. It is vitally important for investors to distinguish stock price fluctuations from underlying business reality. prices move up and down for two basic reasons: to reflect business reality (or investor perceptions of that reality) or to reflect short-term variations in supply and demand. avoiding loss should be the primary goal of every investor. the avoidance of loss is the surest way to ensure a profitable outcome. the actual risk of a particular investment cannot be determined from historical data. It depends on the price paid. the effects of compounding even moderate returns over many years are compelling, if not downright mind boggling. A corollary to the importance of compounding is that it is very difficult to recover from even one large loss, which could literally destroy all at once the beneficial effects of many years of investment success. an investor is more likely to do well by achieving consistently good returns with limited downside risk than by achieving volatile and sometimes even spectacular gains but with considerable risk of principal. An investor who earns 16 percent annual returns over a decade, for example, will, perhaps surprisingly, end up with more money than an investor who earns 20 percent a year for nine years and then loses 15 percent the tenth year. Investors must be willing to forego some near-term return, if necessary, as an insurance premium against unexpected and unpredictable adversity. Rather than targeting a desired rate of return, even an eminently reasonable one, investors should target risk. Treasury bills are the closest thing to a riskless investment; hence the interest rate on Treasury bills is considered the risk-free rate. Value investing is the discipline of buying securities at a significant discount from their current underlying values and holding them until more of their value is realized. An investment must be purchased at a discount from underlying worth. Above all, investors must always avoid swinging at bad pitches. First, since investors cannot predict when values will rise or fall, valuation should always be performed conservatively, giving considerable weight to worst-case liquidation value as well as to other methods. Graham was only interested in buying at a substantial discount from underlying value. By investing at a discount, he knew that he was unlikely to experience losses. The discount provided a margin of safety. Because investing is as much an art as a science, investors need a margin of safety. A margin of safety is achieved when securities are purchased at prices sufficiently below underlying value to allow for human error, bad luck, or extreme volatility in a complex, unpredictable, and rapidly changing world. According to Graham, “The margin of safety is always dependent on the price paid. For any security, it will be large at one price, small at some higher price, nonexistent at some still higher price.” How can investors be certain of achieving a margin of safety? By always buying at a significant discount to underlying business value and giving preference to tangible assets over intangibles. (This does not mean that there are not excellent investment opportunities in businesses with valuable intangible assets.) By replacing current holdings as better bargains come along. By selling when the market price of any investment comes to reflect its underlying value and by holding cash, if necessary, until other attractive investments become available. Give preference to companies having good managements with a personal financial stake in the business. A market downturn is the true test of an investment philosophy. A notable feature of value investing is its strong performance in periods of overall market decline. Whenever the financial markets fail to fully incorporate fundamental values into securities prices, an investor’s margin of safety is high. Value investing is, in effect, predicated on the proposition that the efficient-market hypothesis is frequently wrong. The efficient-market hypothesis takes three forms.3 The weak form maintains that past stock prices provide no useful information on the future direction of stock prices. In other words, technical analysis (analysis of past price fluctuations) cannot help investors. The semi-strong form says that no published information will help investors to select undervalued securities since the market has already discounted all publicly available information into securities prices. The strong form maintains that there is no information, public or private, that would benefit investors. The implication of both the semi-strong and strong forms is that fundamental analysis is useless. Of the three forms of the efficient-market hypothesis, I believe that only the weak form is valid. Specifically, by finding securities whose prices depart appreciably from underlying value, investors can frequently achieve above-average returns while taking below-average risks. The pricing of large-capitalization stocks tends to be more efficient than that of small-capitalization stocks, distressed bonds, and other less-popular investment fare. Investors are more likely, therefore, to find inefficiently priced securities outside the Standard and Poor’s 100 than within many buyers and sellers of securities are motivated by considerations other than underlying value and may be willing to buy or sell at very different prices than a value investor would. The behavior of institutional investors, dictated by constraints on their behavior, can sometimes cause stock prices to depart from underlying value. “Value investing” is one of the most overused and inconsistently applied terms in the investment business. Value investing is simple to understand but difficult to implement. The hard part is discipline, patience, and judgment. There are three central elements to a value-investment philosophy. First, value investing is a bottom-up strategy entailing the identification of specific undervalued investment opportunities. Second, value investing is absoluteperformance-, not relative-performance oriented. Finally, value investing is a risk-averse approach; attention is paid as much to what can go wrong (risk) as to what can go right (return). The entire strategy can be concisely described as “buy a bargain and wait.” In investing it is never wrong to change your mind. It is only wrong to change your mind and do nothing about it. Value investors, by contrast, are absolute-performance oriented; they are interested in returns only insofar as they relate to the achievement of their own investment goals, not how they compare with the way the overall market or other investors are faring. For most investors absolute returns are the only ones that really matter; you cannot, after all, spend relative performance. Absolute-performance-oriented investors, by contrast, are willing to hold cash reserves when no bargains are available. Cash is liquid and provides a modest, sometimes attractive nominal return, usually above the rate of inflation. The liquidity of cash affords flexibility, for it can quickly be channeled into other investment outlets with minimal transaction costs. Finally, unlike any other holding, cash does not involve any risk of incurring opportunity cost (losses from the inability to take advantage of future bargains) since it does not drop in value during market declines. While most other investors are preoccupied with how much money they can make and not at all with how much they may lose, value investors focus on risk as well as return. A positive correlation between risk and return would hold consistently only in an efficient market. Any disparities would be immediately corrected; this is what would make the market efficient. In inefficient markets it is possible to find investments offering high returns with low risk. Risk and return must instead be assessed independently for every investment. It is only when investors shun high-risk investments, thereby depressing their prices, that an incremental return can be earned which more than fully compensates for the risk incurred. By itself risk does not create incremental return; only price can accomplish that. Unlike return, however, risk is no more quantifiable at the end of an investment than it was at its beginning. Risk simply cannot be described by a single number. There are only a few things investors can do to counteract risk: diversify adequately, hedge when appropriate, and invest with a margin of safety. The reality is that past security price volatility does not reliably predict future investment performance (or even future volatility) and therefore is a poor measure of risk. The trick of successful investors is to sell when they want to, not when they have to. Investors who may need to sell should not own marketable securities other than U.S. Treasury bills. If what you hold is illiquid or unmarketable, the opportunity cost increases further; the illiquidity precludes your switching to better bargains. The most important determinant of whether investors will incur opportunity cost is whether or not part of their portfolios is held in cash. Maintaining moderate cash balances or owning securities that periodically throw off appreciable cash is likely to reduce the number of foregone opportunities. An added attraction of investing in riskarbitrage situations, bankruptcies, and liquidations is that not only is one’s initial investment returned to cash, one’s profits are as well. Another way to limit opportunity cost is through hedging. A hedge is an investment that is expected to move in a direction opposite that of another holding so as to cushion any price decline. If the hedge becomes valuable, it can be sold, providing funds to take advantage of newly created opportunities. (Hedging is discussed in greater depth in chapter 13.) Conclusion The primary goal of value investors is to avoid losing money. Three elements of a value-investment strategy make achievement of that goal possible. A bottom-up approach, searching for low-risk bargains one at a time through fundamental analysis, is the surest way I know to avoid losing money. An absolute-performance orientation The primary goal of value investors is to avoid losing money. Markets exist because of differences of opinion among investors. To be a value investor, you must buy at a discount from underlying value. While a great many methods of business valuation exist, there are only three that I find useful. The first is an analysis of going-concern value, known as net present value (NPV) analysis. NPV is the discounted value of all future cash flows that a business is expected to generate. The second method of business valuation analyzes liquidation value, the expected proceeds if a company were to be dismantled and the assets sold off. The third method of valuation, stock market value, is an estimate of the price at which a company, or its subsidiaries considered separately, would trade in the stock market. Less reliable than the other two, this method is only occasionally useful as a yardstick of value. How do value investors deal with the analytical necessity to predict the unpredictable? The only answer is conservatism. Since all projections are subject to error, optimistic ones tend to place investors on a precarious limb. Virtually everything must go right, or losses may be sustained. Conservative forecasts can be more easily met or even exceeded. Investors are well advised to make only conservative projections and then invest only at a substantial discount from the valuations derived therefrom. At times when interest rates are unusually low, however, investors are likely to find very high multiples being applied to share prices. Investors who pay these high multiples are dependent on interest rates remaining low, but no one can be certain that they will. This means that when interest rates are unusually low, investors should be particularly reluctant to commit capital to long-term holdings unless outstanding opportunities become available, with a preference for either holding cash or investing in short-term holdings that quickly return cash for possible redeployment when available returns are more attractive Calculating the present value of contractual interest and principal payments is the best way to value a bond. Analysis of the underlying business can then help analyzing the cash flows of the underlying business is the best way to value a stock. My personal rule is that investors should value businesses based on what they themselves, not others, would pay to own them. The liquidation value of a business is a conservative assessment of its worth in which only tangible assets are considered and intangibles, such as going-concern value, are not. when a stock is selling at a discount to liquidation value per share, a near rock-bottom appraisal, it is frequently an attractive investment. The assets of a company are typically worth more as part of a going concern than in liquidation, so liquidation value is generally a worst-case assessment. Even when a company has little ongoing business value, investors who buy at a price below net-net working capital are protected by the approximate liquidation value of current assets alone. As long as working capital is not overstated and operations are not rapidly consuming cash, a company could liquidate its assets, extinguish all its liabilities, and still distribute proceeds in excess of the market price to investors. value, investors who buy at a price below net-net working capital are protected by the approximate A corporate liquidation typically connotes business failure; but ironically, it may correspond with investment success. The reason is that the liquidation or breakup of a company is a catalyst for the realization of underlying business value. Since value investors attempt to buy securities trading at a considerable discount from the value of a business’s underlying assets, a liquidation is one way for investors to realize profits. Net present value would be most applicable, for example, in valuing a high-return business with stable cash flows such as a consumer-products company; its liquidation value would be far too low. Similarly, a business with regulated rates of return on assets such as a utility might best be valued using NPV analysis. Liquidation analysis is probably the most appropriate method for valuing an unprofitable business whose stock trades well below book value. A closed-end fund or other company that owns only marketable securities should be valued by the stock market method; no other makes sense. an analysis of cash flow would better capture the true economics of a business nonrecurring gains can boost earnings to unsustainable levels, and should be ignored by investors. an analysis of cash flow would better capture the true economics of a business. By contrast, nonrecurring gains can boost earnings to unsustainable levels, and should be ignored by investors. What something cost in the past is not necessarily a good measure of its value today. For every business that cannot be valued, there are many others that can. Investors who confine themselves to what they know, as difficult as that may be, have a considerable advantage over everyone else. the first and perhaps most important step in the investment process is knowing where to look for opportunities. Investors cannot assume that good ideas will come effortlessly from scanning the recommendations of Wall Street analysts, no matter how highly regarded, or from punching up computers, no matter how cleverly programmed, although both can sometimes indicate interesting places to hunt. By identifying where the most attractive opportunities are likely to arise before starting one’s quest for the exciting handful of specific investments, investors can spare themselves an often fruitless survey of the humdrum majority of available investments. Value investing encompasses a number of specialized investment niches that can be divided into three categories: securities selling at a discount to breakup or liquidation value, rate-of-return situations, and asset-conversion opportunities. A bargain should be inspected and re-inspected for possible flaws. Value investing by its very nature is contrarian Out-of-favor securities may be undervalued; popular securities almost never are. What the herd is buying is, by definition, in favor. Securities in favor have already been bid up in price on the basis of optimistic expectations and are unlikely to represent good value that has been overlooked. Since they are acting against the crowd, contrarians are almost always initially wrong and likely for a time to suffer paper losses. By contrast, members of the herd are nearly always right for a period. information generally follows the well-known 80/20 rule: the first 80 percent of the available information is gathered in the first 20 percent of the time spent. The value of in-depth fundamental analysis is subject to diminishing marginal returns. The time other investors spend delving into the last unanswered detail may cost them the chance to buy in at prices so low that they offer a margin of safety despite the incomplete information. the presence of a catalyst serves to reduce risk. If the gap between price and underlying value is likely to be closed quickly, the probability of losing money due to market fluctuations or adverse business developments is reduced. Companies get into financial trouble for at least one of three reasons: operating problems, legal problems, and/or financial problems. an investor’s portfolio management responsibilities include maintaining appropriate diversification, making hedging decisions, and managing portfolio cash flow and liquidity. All investors must come to terms with the relentless continuity of the investment process. Although specific investments have a beginning and an end, portfolio management goes on forever. Since no investor is infallible and no investment is perfect, there is considerable merit in being able to change one’s mind. When investors do not demand compensation for bearing illiquidity, they almost always come to regret it. Because the opportunity cost of illiquidity is high, no investment portfolio should be completely illiquid either. Most portfolios should maintain a balance, opting for greater illiquidity when the market compensates investors well for bearing it. When your portfolio is completely in cash, there is no risk of loss. There is also, however, no possibility of earning a high return. Investing is in some ways an endless process of managing liquidity. when the securities in a portfolio frequently turn into cash, the investor is constantly challenged to put that cash to work, seeking out the best values available. Even relatively safe investments entail some probability, however small, of downside risk. The deleterious effects of such improbable events can best be mitigated through prudent diversification. The number of securities that should be owned to reduce portfolio risk to an acceptable level is not great; as few as ten to fifteen different holdings usually suffice. The number of securities that should be owned to reduce portfolio risk to an acceptable level is not great; as few as ten to fifteen different holdings usually suffice. My view is that an investor is better off knowing a lot about a few investments than knowing only a little about each of a great many holdings. The fact is that a diverse portfolio of overpriced, subordinated securities, about each of which the investor knows relatively little, is highly risky. Diversification, after all, is not how many different things you own, but how different the things you do own are in the risks they entail. There is nothing inherent in a security or business that alone makes it an attractive investment. Investment opportunity is a function of price, which is established in the marketplace. The single most crucial factor in trading is developing the appropriate reaction to price fluctuations In my view, investors should usually refrain from purchasing a “full position” (the maximum dollar commitment they intend to make) in a given security all at once. Those who fail to heed this advice may be compelled to watch a subsequent price decline helplessly, with no buying power in reserve. Buying a partial position leaves reserves that permit investors to “average down,” lowering their average cost per share, if prices decline. there is only one valid rule for selling: all investments are for sale at the right price. Decisions to sell, like decisions to buy, must be based upon underlying business value."
The Tell-Tale Brain by V.S. Ramachandran,"Humans are unique among the animal kingdom because of their brain. The human brain evolved through two methods: biological evolution, which takes a long time and cultural evolution, which is incredibly fast by comparison. These evolutionary processes have resulted in the development of mirror neurons, which contribute to our remarkable levels of creativity, ambition, communication.","The author has unearthed many of his discoveries by working with people who have interesting or strange brain injuries and disabilities. The Heinsenberg Principle reveals that at the subatomic level even our most basic sense of cause and effect breaks down. The deciphering of the genetic code in the 1950s marked the birth of modern biology. Humans are different, plain and simple. We are not “just another ape.” It is impossible to understand the human brain without understanding how it evolved. “Nothing in biology makes sense, except in light of evolution.” -Theodosius Dobzhansky Fascinating: many traits evolved from previous traits with very different functions. For example, wings evolved from scales. The original purpose was insulation not flight. Evolution found ways to radically repurpose functions in the ape brain into remarkably more powerful functions in the human brain. “All good science emerges from an imaginative conception of what might be true.” -Peter Medawar Ramachandran loves “small science” which doesn't require big teams or lots of technology and can be repeated by almost anyone. Homogeneity breeds weakness. Science (and life) needs many different styles and viewpoints. Application for mental models: Many scientists let the most expensive equipment drive their research and not the most interesting questions. If your lab spends $1 million on a state of the art brain imaging machine, then you tend to get pressured to use it at all times. Every scientific problem gets forced through the lens of one machine. Consider how often we do this with our thinking and our decision making. How often do we let one identity (politics, religion, capitalism, etc.) dictate all of our thinking? (See Paul Graham's “Keep your identity small.”) How often does the highest paid person's mental model win out? (See: HiPPOs.) Be careful to not let investments overpower mental models. Humans are part of the animal kingdom, descendants of apes, but also transcendent and unique among the animal kingdom. We are both. Incremental changes do not always lead to incremental results. Sometimes there is a “phase transition” like heating a block of ice from 31 degrees to 32 degrees. Phase transitions can occur in society as well. The rise of the Internet, new political orders, etc. Sometime around 150,000 years ago, this phase transition happened within the human brain. We can view evolution as going through two avenues: biological, which takes a very long time and cultural, which is shockingly fast by comparison. Ideas evolve much faster than bodies do. The cortex of most other mammal brains is mostly smooth and flat whereas the human cortex has grown so much that it has developed many folds and valleys to increase surface area (the walnut-like appearance). The cortex is especially well developed in dolphins and primates. An intention tremor is an example of an oscillating feedback loop in the human body. (Thinking in Systems makes the point that delays in feedback loops lead to oscillations in systems.) Biology so clearly drives behavior. Damage to the basal ganglia, for example, can lead to Parkinson's and a shuffling gate. This new behavior (a shuffling walk) is not a choice on the patient's part. It is simply a consequence of changes in the neurological structure of the brain. We are quick to admit the influence of biological factors on behavior in cases like these, but we too often overlook them otherwise. Wernicke's area in the brain plays a critical role in language and deciphering meaning. It is 7x larger in human than in other primates and is one of the key biological differences between our brain and other animals. Some of the complex traits that embody human nature: ambition, empathy, and foresight. At least three areas have developed extraordinarily rapidly in human brains relative to other primates: Wernicke’s area, the prefrontal cortex, and the IPL region in each parietal lobe. These three areas structurally evolved in small steps, but functionally they led to massive leaps forward compared to other primates. Within some of these regions there is a special class of nerve cells called mirror neurons. These fire not only when you perform an action, but also when you watch someone else perform an action. Mirror neurons are incredibly important and are an area of huge research focus right now. They may be central to social learning, imitation, and the cultural transmission of skills and attitudes. Mirror neurons are hyper developed in humans compared to animals. This allowed humans to learn new skills within just one or two generations as opposed to the hundreds or thousands of generations required for genetic evolution. Cultural evolution operates at light speed compared to genetic evolution. Look up servo loop. Experience modifies the brain by strengthening or weakening the synapses that link neurons together. The regions of the brain are not cleanly divided in their roles and functions, but rather work together in a remarkable fashion. They are strongly linked and some regions can even take over functions for damaged areas. There is much redundancy among the brain areas. Humans are the only species to use neural plasticity to such an extreme degree. You've probably noticed how reliant humans are on their parents compared to say, how a baby giraffe can walk within hours of being born. This is not a weakness, but rather a strength because it allows humans to maintain remarkable brain plasticity during the first ten years of life. Vision is so incredibly powerful for living creatures that it evolved separately in different species. When you see something the light rays seen by your eye are converted into nerve impulses. There is no image in your head. Just impulses that describe it to your brain – like writing could describe how a chair looks even though the words on the paper look nothing like the chair itself. Wieskrantz’s studies on blindsight offer an interesting look at nonconscious sight. The patient was able to point at a spot on the wall correctly time after time despite saying that he could not see the spot at all. The Coolidge Effect: the phenomenon where males are sexually excited by new partners over and over again. Proven by a seldom known rat study where a sex deprived rat has sex with a female until exhausted. Then a new female is introduced and it happens again. And then again even though the rat was seemingly exhausted before. Synesthesia occurs when someone experiences the combining of senses. For example, the number 7 might seem red or chicken might taste “pointy.” In the fetus there is a massive over connection of neurons and then they are gradually pruned down to strengthen and prioritize certain connections. One fascinating explanation of synesthesia is that two adjacent areas of the brain are crosswired which leads to increased crosstalk between, say, colors and numbers. Interesting theory: a high percentage of artists and creators have been reported to have synesthesia. It's quite possible that the cross linkage between neurons that leads to synesthesia also enables artists to create metaphors and connections between ideas in an easier fashion than most people. It is very possible that the crosswiring of adjacent areas of the brain was selected for by evolution because it enabled those people to be more creative (and thus increase the odds of survival) with the unharmful side effect that some people would experience synesthesia. This is how science works: begin with simple, tractable questions that can be answered and will pave the way to the big questions. Humans mature at a glacial pace compared to most animals. What do we gain from this vulnerable period that would seem to decrease our odds of survival? The answer is culture. Culture is transferred from person to person through language and imitation. Accurate imitation depends on our unique human ability to see the world from someone else’s vantage point. Humans can develop a mental model of what others think of them. This is known as a “theory of mind” and our ability to construct these scenarios in our head is unique to humans. There are still many important questions about the evolution of the human mind that remain unanswered. Here are Ramachandran’s five big unanswered questions about the evolution of the human brain: Wallace’s Problem: The human brain reached its present size about 300,000 years ago, yet many of our modern attributes like tool making, fire, and perhaps even language appeared only about 75,000 years ago. Why did it take so long for all of this latent potential to blossom? And why did it blossom so suddenly? 2) Homo habilis likely created the first tools 2.4 million years ago. What was the role of tool use in shaping human cognition? 3) Why was there a sudden explosion in human cognition around 60,000 years ago? Widespread clothing and shelters show up around this time. (Jared Diamond refers to this as “the great leap.”) 4) Why are humans so good at reading one another’s intentions? Why can we develop theories of others minds? Why do humans have better neural circuits for this than any other animal? 5) How did language evolve? Natural selection can only select for expressed abilities, not latent ones. Giacomo Rizzolatti's study showed that monkeys had some ability to read another monkey’s mind, which means they had some mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are like “nature’s own virtual reality simulations of the intentions of other beings.” They allow you to envision what someone else is doing and to predict what will happen next. This is how we interpret other people’s complex intentions. Mirror neurons also allow you to imitate the skills of others, which makes it possible for us to inherit the skills and culture of others. Anytime you watch someone doing something, the neurons your brain would use to do the same thing become active as if you yourself were doing it. The brain and free will: Your brain has to inhibit yourself from imitating everything you see, so there are some inhibitory circuits that cut off those actions. This might be how free will occurs. You are presented with many options and your brain ignores all but one of them. The brain has multiple layers of communication between neurons. If you see someone experiencing pain but your skin receptors do not experience pain, then your body knows it is not happening to you and so you empathize with that person rather than actually feel their pain. Mirror neurons appear to be wired from birth to some degree. A newborn baby, just a few hours old, will often echo its mother by sucking its tongue out when watching its mother do it. Mirror neurons have multiple functions. They allow you to predict another person's intentions. They allow you to adopt someone else's point of view and to see yourself as others see you (self-awareness). They allow you to transform a map in one dimension into a map in another dimension (ex. visual to auditory). Imitation was one of the key steps in the evolution of humans. Imitation allows us to learn by example, which means we made the massive shift from Darwinian evolution (which takes millions of years) to cultural evolution (which can spread ideas and skills rapidly). IQ as a measure of intelligence sort of misses the point because intelligence is a collection of complex, multifaceted abilities not one general ability. Interesting: two doctors discovered autism independently and, incredibly, they both named the condition “autism.” Ramachandran ran an experiment where subjects bit a pencil horizontally, so it shaped their mouth somewhat like a smile. While in this position, their brains would register someone’s frown, but would not imitate someone else’s smile. The hypothesis was that the mirror neurons which would fire while looking at and imitating someone else’s smile were already busy with the own person’s smile (or similar shape), thus they did not fire. In some ways, this link between imitation and action reminds me of Brene Brown’s idea that it is much harder to be closed off emotionally if you are active physically. It’s like if the body is moving, the activity in your neurons makes it harder to “close off” emotional pathways. Humans have an incredible capacity for language. It is one of the traits that separates us most clearly from the rest of the animal kingdom. Interesting definition of natural selection: the progressive series of chance variations that enhance the organism's ability to pass on its genes to the next generation. Alfred Russell Wallace independently discovered natural selection. He deserves more credit than he gets. You can't get very far in science by trying to explain one mystery with another mystery. Trying to ascribe a numerical value to how much genes or environment impact the outcome misses the point. Both impact it and the percentage to which it impacts it can vary widely. The key is to realize they are connected and not to worry about some single numerical value. Psychologists often make this mistake – especially when discussing IQ as a single trait. The PKU example showcases how the same problem can appear completely genetic or completely environmental under different conditions. How it is possible for neural circuitry to embody meaning is one of the great unsolved mysteries of neuroscience. The three bones in the inner ear of mammals – the malleus, incus, and stapes – actually evolved from the jaws of reptiles, which have three bones in their jaw rather than the one bone (mandible) in mammals. It's fascinating how many functions in the body would never have been designed that way from scratch, but just resulted from “works for now” evolutionary adaptations. There seem to be some universal factors in the recognition of beauty. For example, tropical male birds developed remarkably beautiful feathers to attract females of their own species, but humans find them beautiful as well and use them in headdresses. Perhaps there is a fundamental “truth” of aesthetics that speaks to all creatures. Bowerbirds create very detailed nests in an effort to court a mate. They are even original artists with different birds (within the same species) having different aesthetic tastes and styles. Another interesting example of how beauty might have some fundamental principles that extend outside the human concept of art. Three questions to ask when analyzing any human trait. 1) What is the internal logical structure of the trait you are looking at? 2) Why does the particular trait have the structure it does? What did it evolve for? 3) How is this trait mediated by the neural machinery in the brain? Knowing the small details doesn't mean you comprehend the whole picture. Vision evolved to discover and respond to objects: recognize them, eat them, catch them, or mate with them quickly and reliably. Ramachandran refers to a phenomenon known as The Peak Shift Effect, which is also called supernormal stimuli by other experts. It seems like a very powerful concept to me. It essentially says that the brain learns certain rules for discriminating between things and that if you present the brain with an exaggerated version of that rule, it strongly prefers it. Tinbergen’s famous studies on herrings provide a good example. Baby herrings will peck at a red spot on their mother’s beak when they want food. If a research presents a fake beak with three red spots, then the baby herring goes berserk. This supernormal stimuli is preferred by the brain as if the baby bird is saying, “Wow! What a beak.” Caricatures are an example of supernormal stimuli in human art. Caricatures amplifying the features of a given face. Also, many female sculptures have exaggerated breasts and hips, which seems to be preferred by our brains. Most theories are stated in a way that doesn’t even allow them to be tested or proven wrong. This isn’t really science. It’s just conjecture. Science requires you to state a hypothesis (or theory) and then develop an experimental way of testing to see if it is confirmed or refuted. There are three ways to test ideas about peak shift (and other supernormal stimuli). 1) Galvanic skin response (GSR) tests, 2) recording nerve impulses from single nerve cells in the visual area in the brain, 3) utilizing your “laws” or hypotheses to create more reliable, consistent, or successful results. Your brain has 100 billion nerve cells, but only a small subset can be active in any given instant. (How many, exactly?) Ramachandran conducts an interesting exercise in class where people must rank three drawings of a horse. One drawn by an autistic seven year old is often preferred to one down by Leonardo DaVinci. ( The three pictures .) The Isolation Principle. There appears to be some aspect of isolation in the brain that can lead to enhanced creativity. For example, when autistic children have damaged or poorly functioning areas of the brain it often opens up the ability for one area (like the right parietal lobe) to receive more attention and results in remarkable creativity (like drawing). Idea: I also wonder how much other areas of the brain dampen signals to a given area and when they are damaged (like in autistic children) reduced dampening leads to greater creativity. It's possible regular folks have latent creative talent waiting to be unleashed but it is being held back by inhibition from other brain areas (which is normal) and only arises when those inhibitors are damaged. There were some remarkable brain studies conducted in Australia, which used TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) to deactivate parts of normal people's brains for a few moments. Almost instantly they could draw better or perform mathematical feats. This supports The Isolation Principle. The process of vision is carried out through a series of processes and feedback loops in the brain. This occurs in such a way that multiple visual options are presented, but only one wins out – the final image you see. In this sense, vision and hallucination are closely related. We are always “hallucinating” and our brain selects the one hallucination that seems to most closely match reality based on the external stimuli we receive. Our minds prefer symmetrical faces. Even minor deviations in symmetry are seen as undesirable. There is an evolutionary explanation for this. Parasitic infestations During infancy can cause small variations in symmetry. So, biological health is somewhat tied to symmetry. Interestingly, the male brain may prefer blondes over brunettes because it is easier to identify certain ailments like jaundice in a fair blonde complexion than in brunettes. In other words, it's easier to judge if a blonde is a healthy mate. The self consists of many components and the notion of one, unitary self may be an illusion. Qualia is the word for your unique sense and perception of the world. It refers to how things seem to you. Examples: the pain of breaking your leg or the color of a sunset. Qualia refers to your subjective experience of the world. Qualia (your subjective experience) and the self are different things, but you can’t get qualia without a self. Freud, despite his faults, was correct that the modern brain is largely unconscious and that the conscious self is but a small slice of our whole world. The self seems to emerge from a relatively small cluster of brain areas. Blindsight is an example of how your conscious mind is tied to your visual cortex, yet a lot of other information you are taking in can be processed nonconsciously. The human brain and body seem to have a default tendency for harmony. We feel tension that needs to be resolved if there is a mismatch between our conscious mind and nonconcious body. (Extreme examples: transsexual man trapped in female body or phantom limb.) Neuroscience is currently at the stage chemistry was at in the 19th century. Grouping together the basic elements of the field and not yet attempting any grand, all-encompassing theories. Science tells us that humans are animals, another type of beast. But, importantly, we don't feel that way. We feel like angels who aspire to become something more than a mere animal. So, perhaps we are both an animal and an angel."
Not Fade Away by Laurence Shames and Peter Barton,It is more important to live fully than to live in a straight line. The surest gauge of the impact a life makes is how many other lives it touches. Nothing in life looks the same once you truly understand that you are not exempt from death.,"On taking time to find yourself: “What's unworthy about working to understand who you truly are and what you really want from life? What better use can a person make of his youth?” A side effect of taking time to find yourself and goofing off: you gradually find that you are becoming ready to be mature, responsible, hard working, etc. “Nothing which gives comfort [to someone in need of comfort] should ever be despised.” “Money needed to be worked for but not fretted over. It would appear when required. In the meantime, better to climb trees and build snowmen. In other words, to live.” “The big things in life are best understood by way of small things.” Be careful what you tell children. They can be easily hurt and we remember how we feel for a lifetime. There are many people who hurt, physically or emotionally, on a daily basis. For them, normal tasks require monumental effort. Remember this and be compassionate and patient. How many of us truly grasp the simple fact that we will die before it is thrust into our face? “Truthfully, my mistakes don't seem to have mattered very much. They were dumb, not evil, and dumb is part of every life.” “People of our generation seemed to agree it was more important to live fully than to live in a straight line.” We often talk and think about what we have done, but what really matters is that we are there. That we show up at all. It's a shared sense of community and connection that matters most, regardless of the cause. “A problem that can be fixed by money … is not a problem.” “If you've got your health, you can always make some money. But all the dough in the world can't buy back your health.” “Isn't it clear that the person who compromises his health in the name of making money is cutting himself a really lousy deal?” Everyone says that health is really important but if you look at how people actually live they seem to believe the opposite. “Maybe the single best thing about having money is that it makes money seem a great deal less important.” “I mistrust rigid definitions. They're the beginning of dogma, and dogma is the start of narrow-mindedness.” It can be easy to get trapped in life. “Staying on a track can kill, one easy day at a time.” It is often easier to amend your own beliefs than change an organization. Thus, you convince yourself to work somewhere you don't really want to work or do something you don't really believe in. “By increments so exquisitely gradual that they might have passed unnoticed, I could have ended up being totally untrue to myself and living a life I hated.” “Wealth is a great deal more enjoyable if you've already taught yourself that you can have a good time without it.” “I promised myself that I wouldn't have a bad day for the rest of my life. If someone was wasting my time, I'd excuse myself and walk away. If a situation bothered me or refused to get resolved, I'd shrug and move on.” “Mortality doesn't limit us only in time. It limits us, as well, in what we hope to understand.” “Nothing looks exactly the same once you truly understand that you are not exempt from death.” “The truth is that getting ready to die is tough and painful–more so, I believe, than the merely physical torments that define a bad disease.” I love how he describes old age as “the leisurely adventure of growing old with my wife.” “…their obsession with detail was a way of masking cluelessness about the bigger picture.” His discussion of happiness in bleak circumstances on pages 140-141 is a personal anecdote that resonates with the science shared in Stumbling on Happiness by Dan Gilbert. His three rules for finding a job: 1) I would only work for someone I thought to be wildly smart. 2) I would only work for the head of the company. 3) I would only work in an up-and-coming industry. He went into the cable television business because, in 1982, it's best years were still ahead. “The industry was essentially a government-subsidized monopoly, financed by huge tax breaks. It was young and fragmented–there was big money to be made in the process of consolidation.” “Giving up is when you're in a contest and you acknowledge that you've lost. Acceptance is when you graduate to a different way of looking at the situation.” “Illness has always been a temporary setback… Nothing prepares us for that one illness that doesn't go away.” Fun idea: he wore the same shirt at all three of his children's births. “My birthing shirt.” Each moment is a life. Life is renewed every time we are walloped by beauty, every time we are shaken up by gratitude and love. He set a rule to be home every day by 6pm to see his kids and stuck to it nearly his entire career despite helping to run a multimillion dollar company. He created “field trips” for his kids and their friends organized around different topics like grease (fast food), garbage (garbage men and recycling), luggage (luggage factory and airports). Sounds fun and cool and the kids loved it. If cancer beats you it is “such a hollow and inglorious triumph. Because the moment I die, the tumor starts to die as well. The cancer will have killed itself as well as me.” “The surest gauge of the scale of a life is how many other lives it touches.”"
